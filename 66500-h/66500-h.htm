<p>This Work first appeared in November, 1822.
It was a juvenile production, and, of course,
deformed with all the faults and extravagances of
nineteen. The Public, however, received it with
some degree of encouragement; and, a second
edition being now called for, I have gladly seized
the opportunity of repairing early errors, by greater
correctness of language and more copious information.
The present volume will be found to contain
thrice the quantity of letterpress, and a much greater
variety of interesting details.</p>

<p>In the belief that there are many admirers of Sir
Walter Scott who would gladly welcome the reappearance
of a work which many years ago was,
in connection with his novels, eagerly perused, the
“Illustrations of the Author of Waverley” have been
again printed.</p>

made their memorable attack, a battery of four
field-pieces was stormed and carried by the Camerons and Stuarts of
Appine. The late Alexander Stuart of Invernahyle was one of the
foremost in the charge, and observed an officer of the king’s forces,
who, scorning to join the flight of all around, remained with his
sword in his hand, as if determined to the very last to defend the post
assigned to him. The Highland gentleman commanded him to surrender,
and received for reply a thrust, which he caught in his target.
The officer was now defenceless, and the battle-axe of a gigantic
Highlander (the miller of Invernahyle’s mill), was uplifted to dash
his brains out, when Mr. Stuart with difficulty prevailed on him
to surrender. He took charge of his enemy’s property, protected
his person, and finally obtained him liberty on parole. The officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">{2}</span>
proved to be Colonel Allan Whiteford, of Ballochmyle, in Ayrshire, a
man of high character and influence, and warmly attached to the House
of Hanover; yet such was the confidence existing between these two
honourable men, though of different political principles, that, while
the civil war was raging, and straggling officers from the Highland
army were executed without mercy, Invernahyle hesitated not to pay
his late captive a visit, as he went back to the Highlands to raise fresh
recruits, when he spent a few days among Colonel Whiteford’s whig
friends as pleasantly and good humouredly as if all had been at peace
around him.</p>

<p>“After the battle of Culloden, it was Colonel Whiteford’s turn to
strain every nerve to obtain Mr. Stuart’s pardon. He went to the
Lord Justice Clerk, to the Lord Advocate, and to all the officers of
State, and each application was answered by the production of a list,
in which the name of Invernahyle appeared ‘marked with the sign
of the beast!’ At length Colonel Whiteford went to the Duke of
Cumberland. From him also he received a positive refusal. He then
limited his request, for the present, to a protection for Stuart’s house,
wife, children, and property. This was also refused by the Duke; on
which Colonel Whiteford, taking his commission from his bosom, laid
it on the table before his Royal Highness, and asked permission to
retire from the service of a king who did not know how to spare a
vanquished enemy. The Duke was struck, and even affected. He
bade the Colonel take up his commission, and granted the protection
he requested with so much earnestness. It was issued just in time to
save the house, corn, and cattle at Invernahyle from the troops who
were engaged in laying waste what it was the fashion to call ‘the country
of the enemy.’ A small encampment was formed on Invernahyle’s
property, which they spared while plundering the country around, and
searching in every direction for the leaders of the insurrection, and for
Stuart in particular. He was much nearer them than they suspected;
for, hidden in a cave, (like the Baron of Bradwardine,) he lay for many
days within hearing of the sentinels as they called their watchword.
His food was brought him by one of his daughters, a child of eight
years old, whom Mrs. Stuart was under the necessity of trusting with
this commission, for her own motions and those of all her inmates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">{3}</span>
were closely watched. With ingenuity beyond her years, the child
used to stray out among the soldiers, who were rather kind to her, and
watch the moment when she was unobserved, to steal into the thicket,
when she deposited whatever small store of provisions she had in
charge, at some marked spot, where her father might find it. Invernahyle
supported life for several weeks by means of these precarious
supplies; and, as he had been wounded in the battle of Culloden,
the hardships which he endured were aggravated by great bodily pain.
After the soldiers had removed their quarters, he had another remarkable
escape. As he now ventured to the house at night, and left it in
the morning, he was espied during the dawn by a party who pursued
and fired at him. The fugitive being fortunate enough to escape their
search, they returned to the house, and charged the family with
harbouring one of the proscribed traitors. An old woman had presence
of mind enough to maintain that the man they had seen was the
shepherd. “Why did he not stop when we called to him?” said the
soldiers. “He is as deaf, poor man, as a peat-stack,” answered the
ready-witted domestic. “Let him be sent for directly.” The real
shepherd accordingly was brought from the hill, and, as there was
time to tutor him by the way, he was as deaf, when he made his
appearance, as was necessary to maintain his character. Stuart of
Invernahyle was afterwards pardoned under the act of indemnity.</p>

<p>“He was a noble specimen of the old Highlander, far-descended,
gallant, courteous, and brave even to chivalry. He had been <i>out</i> in
1715 and 1745; was an active partaker in all the stirring scenes which
passed in the Highlands between these memorable eras; and was
remarkable, among other exploits, for having fought with and
vanquished Rob Roy, in a trial of skill at the broadsword, a short
time previous to the death of that celebrated hero, at the clachan of
Balquhidder. He chanced to be in Edinburgh when Paul Jones came
into the Firth of Forth, and, though then an old man, appeared in
arms, and was heard to exult (to use his own words) in the prospect
of ‘drawing his claymore once more before he died.’”</p>

<p>This pleasing anecdote is given in a critique upon the first series of
the “Tales of my Landlord,” (supposed to be written by Sir Walter
Scott,) in the thirty-second number of the <i>Quarterly Review</i>; and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">{4}</span>
heartily concur with the learned Baronet in thinking it the groundwork
of “Waverley.”</p>

<p>Yet it is somewhat remarkable that the name of a Major Talbot,
as well as that of Lieutenant-Colonel Whiteford, occurs in the list
of prisoners published by the Highland army, after their victory at
Prestonpans.</p>

<p>The late Alexander Campbell, author of the “History of Poetry in
Scotland,” and editor of “Albyn’s Anthology,” a gentleman whose
knowledge of his native Highlands was at once extensive and accurate,
used to assert that it was the <i>younger sister</i>, not the <i>daughter</i> of Mr.
Stuart, that brought his food. He had heard an account of the
affecting circumstance from her own mouth.</p>

<p>Stuart of Invernahyle marked his attachment to the cause of the
exiled Prince by the composition of a beautiful song, which is to be
found in Mr. Hogg’s “Jacobite Relics.”</p>


<h3>BRADWARDINE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> the genus of Bradwardine, Colonel Stewart gives the following
account:—</p>

<p>“The armies of Sweden, Holland, and France gave employment
to the younger sons of the Highland gentry, who were educated
abroad in the seminaries of Leyden and Douay. Many of these
returned with a competent knowledge of modern languages added to
their classical education—often speaking Latin with more purity than
Scotch, which, in many cases, they only learned after leaving their
native homes. The race of Bradwardine is not long extinct. In my
own time, several veterans might have sat for the picture of that most
honourable, brave, learned, and kind-hearted personage. These
gentlemen returned from the continent full of warlike Latin, French
phrases, and inveterate broad Scotch. One of the last of these,
Colonel Alexander Robertson, of the Scotch Brigade, uncle of the
present” (now late) “Strowan, I well remember.</p>

<p>“Another of the Bradwardine character is still remembered by the
Highlanders with a degree of admiration bordering on enthusiasm.
This was John Stewart, of the family of Kincardine, in Strathspey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">{5}</span>
known to the country by the name of John Roy Stewart, an accomplished
gentleman, an elegant scholar, a good poet, and a brave
officer. He composed with equal facility in English, Latin and Gaelic;
but it was chiefly by his songs, epigrams, and descriptive pieces, that
he attracted the admiration of his countrymen. He was an active
leader in the rebellion of 1745, and, during his ‘hiding’ of many
months, he had more leisure to indulge his taste for poetry and song.
The country traditions are full of his descriptive pieces, eulogies and
laments on friends, or in allusion to the events of that unfortunate
period. He had been long in the service of France and Portugal, and
had risen to the rank of colonel. He was in Scotland in 1745, and
commanded a regiment, composed of the tenants of his family and a
considerable number of the followers of Sir George Stewart of Grandtully,
who had been placed under him. With these, amounting in
all to 400 men, he joined the rebel army, and proved one of its ablest
partizans.”—<i>Sketches, vol.</i> ii. <i>notes</i>.</p>

<p>Diligent research, however, has enabled us to point out a much
nearer original.</p>

<p>The person who held the situation in the rebel army which in the
novel has been assigned to the Baron, namely, the command of their
few cavalry, was Alexander, fourth Lord Forbes of Pitsligo. This
nobleman, who possessed but a moderate fortune, was so much
esteemed for his excellent qualities of temper and understanding, that
when, after the battle of Prestonpans, he declared his purpose of
joining Prince Charles, most of the gentlemen in that part of the
country put themselves under his command, thinking they could not
follow a better or safer example than the conduct of Lord Pitsligo.
He thus commanded a body of 150 well mounted gentlemen in the
subsequent scenes of the rebellion, at the fatal close of which he
escaped to France, and was attainted, in the following month, by the
title of <i>Lord Pitsligo</i>, his estate and honours being of course forfeited
to the crown. After this he claimed the estate before the Court of
Session, on account of the misnomer, his title being properly <i>Lord
Forbes of Pitsligo</i>; and that Court gave judgment in his favour, 16th
November, 1749; but on an appeal it was reversed by the House of
Lords, 1750.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">{6}</span></p>

<p>Like Bradwardine, Lord Pitsligo had been <i>out</i> in 1715 also—though
it does not appear that much notice was then taken of his defection.
His opposition to the whiggery of modern times had been equally
constant, and of long standing; for he was one of those staunch and
honourable though mistaken patriots of the last Scottish Parliament,
who had opposed the Union.</p>

<p>He could also boast of a smattering of the <i>belles lettres</i>; and probably
plumed himself upon his literary attainments as much as the grim old
pedant, his counterpart. In 1734, he published “Essays, Moral and
Philosophical;” and something of the same sort appeared in 1761,
when he seems to have been in the near prospect of a conclusion to
his earthly trials. He died at Auchiries, in Aberdeenshire, December
21, 1762, at an advanced age, after having possessed his title, counting
from his accession in 1691, during a period of seventy-one years.</p>

<p>It is not unworthy of remark, that the supporters of Lord Pitsligo’s
arms were two bears proper; which circumstance, connected with the
great favour in which these animals were held by Bradwardine, brings
the relation between the real and the fictitious personages very close.</p>


<h3>SCOTTISH FOOLS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Davie Gellatley.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> appears that licensed fools were customary appendages of the
Scottish Court at a very early period; and the time is not long gone
by when such beings were retained at the table and in the halls of
various respectable noblemen. The absence of more refined amusements
made them become as necessary a part of a baronial establishment
as horses and hounds still continue to be in the mansions of many
modern squires. When as yet the pursuits of literature were not, and
ere gaming had become vicious enough to be fashionable, the rude
humours of the jester could entertain a pick-tooth hour; and, what
walnuts now are to wine, and enlightened conversation to the amusements
of the drawing-room, the boisterous bacchanalianism of our
ancestors once found in coarse buffooneries and the alternate darkness
and radiance of a foolish mind.</p>

<p>In later times, when all taste for such diversion had gone out, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">{7}</span>
madman of the country-side frequently found shelter and patronage
under the roofs of neighbouring gentlemen; but though the <i>good things</i>
of <i>Daft Jamie</i> and <i>Daft Wattie</i> were regularly listened to by the laird,
and preserved in the traditions of the household, the encouragement
given to them was rather extended out of a benevolent compassion for
their helpless condition than from any desire to make their talents a
source of entertainment. Such was the motive of Bradwardine in
protecting Davie Gellatley; and such was also that of the late Earl
of Wemyss, in the support which he gave to the renowned Willie
Howison, a personage of whom many anecdotes are yet told in Haddingtonshire,
and whose services at Gosford House were not unlike
those of Davie at Tully-Veolan.</p>

<p>Till within the last few years, these unfortunate persons were more
frequently to be found in their respective villages throughout the
country than now; and it is not long since even Edinburgh could
boast of her “<i>Daft Laird</i>,” her “<i>Bailie Duff</i>,” and her “<i>Madam
Bouzie</i>.” Numerous charitable institutions now seclude most of them
from the world. Yet, in many retired districts, where delicacy is not
apt to be shocked by sights so common, the blind, the dumb, and the
insane are still permitted to mix indiscriminately with their fellow-creatures.
Poverty compels many parents to take the easiest method
of supporting their unfortunate offspring—that of bringing them up
with the rest of the family; the decent pride of the Scottish peasant
also makes an application to charity, even in such a case as this, a
matter of very rare occurrence; and while superstition points out that
those whom God has sent into the world with less than the full share
of mental faculties are always made most peculiarly the objects of this
care, thus rendering the possession of such a child rather a medium
through which the blessings of heaven are diffused than a burden or a
curse, the affectionate desire of administering to them all those tender
offices which their unhappy situation so peculiarly requires, of tending
them with their own eyes, and nursing them with their own hands, that
large and overflowing, but not supererogatory share of tenderness with
which the darkened and destitute objects are constantly regarded by
parents—altogether make their domestication a matter of strong, and
happily not unpleasing necessity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">{8}</span></p>

<p>The rustic idiots of Scotland are also in general blessed with a few
peculiarities, which seldom fail to make them objects of popular esteem
and affection. Many of them exhibit a degree of sagacity or cunning,
bearing the same relation to the rest of their intellectual faculties which,
in the ruins of a Grecian temple, the coarse and entire foundations
bear to the few and scattered but beautiful fragments of the superstructure.
This humble qualification, joined sometimes to the more
agreeable one of a shrewd and sly humour, while it enables them to
keep their own part, and occasionally to baffle sounder judgments,
proves an engaging subject of amusement and wonder to the cottage
fireside. A wild and wayward fancy, powers of song singularly great,
together with a full share of the above qualifications, formed the chief
characteristics of Daft Jock Gray of Gilmanscleugh, whom we are
about to introduce to the reader as the counterpart of Davie Gellatley.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Gray</span> is a native of Gilmanscleugh, a farm in the parish of
Ettrick, of which his father was formerly the shepherd, and from
which, according to Border custom, he derives his popular designation
or title “<span class="smcap">of Gilmanscleugh</span>.” Jock is now above forty years of
age, and still wanders through the neighbouring counties of Roxburgh,
Selkirk, and Peebles, in a half minstrel, half mendicant manner, finding,
even after the fervour of youth is past, no pleasure in a sedentary
or domestic life.</p>

<p>Many months, many weeks, had not elapsed after Jock came into
the world, before all the old women of the <i>Faculty</i> in the parish discovered
that “he had a want.” As he grew up, it was found that he
had no capacity for the learning taught at the parish school, though, in
receiving various other sorts of lore, he showed an aptitude far surpassing
that of more highly gifted children. Thus, though he had not
steadiness of mind to comprehend the alphabet, and Barrie’s smallest
primer was to him as a fountain closed and a book sealed, he caught,
at a wonderfully early age, and with a rapidity almost incredible, many
fragments of Border song, which he could repeat, with the music, in
the precise manner of those who instructed him; and indeed he discovered
an almost miraculous power of giving utterance to sounds, in
all their extensive and intricate varieties.</p>

<p>All endeavours on the part of his parents to communicate to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">{9}</span>
mind the seeds of written knowledge having failed, Jock was abandoned
to the oral lore he loved so much; and of this he soon possessed
himself of an immense stock. His boyhood was passed in perfect
idleness; yet if it could have been proved upon him that he had the
smallest glimmering of sense, his days would not have been so easy.
In Jock’s native district there are just two ways for a boy to spend his
time; either he must go to school, or he must tend the cows; and it
generally happens that he goes to school in summer and tends the
cows in winter. But Jock’s idiocy, like Caleb Balderstone’s “fire,”
was an excuse for every duty. As to the first employment, his friend
the Dominie bore him out with flying colours; for the second, the
question was set for ever at rest by a <i>coup de main</i> achieved by the
rascal’s own happy fancy. “John,” says the minister of Yarrow to
him one day, “you are the idlest boy in the parish; you do nothing
all day but go about from house to house; you might at least herd a
few cows.” “Me, sir!” says Jock, with the most stolid stare imaginable,
“how could I herd the kye? Losh, sir, <i>I disna ken corn by
garse</i>!”—This happy bit was enough to keep Jock comfortable all the
rest of his life.</p>

<p>Yet though Jock did not like to be tied down to any regular task,
and heartily detested both learning and herding, it could never be said
of him that he was sunk in what the country people call <i>even-down
idleset</i>. He sometimes condescended to be useful in running errands,
and would not grudge the tear and wear of his legs upon a seven-mile
journey, when he had the prospect of a halfpenny for his pains; for,
like all madmen, he was not insensible, however stupid in every other
thing, to the value of money, and knew a bawbee from a button with
the sharpest boy in the clachan. It is recorded to his credit, that in all
his errands he was ever found scrupulously honest. He was sometimes
sent to no less a distance than Innerleithen, which must be at least
seven miles from Gilmanscleugh, to procure small grocery articles for
his neighbours. Here an old woman, named Nelly Bathgate, kept
the metropolitan grocery shop of the parish, forming a sort of cynosure
to a district extending nearly from Selkirk to Peebles. This was in
the days before <i>St. Ronan’s Well</i> had drawn so many fashionables
around that retired spot; and as yet Nelly flourished in her little shop,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">{10}</span>
undisturbed by opposition, like the moon just before the creation of the
stars. Rivals innumerable have now sprung up around honest Nelly;
and her ancient and respectable, but unpretending sign-board, simply
importing, “<span class="smcap">N. Bathgate, Grocer</span>,” quails under the glowing and
gilt-lettered rubrics of “—— ——, <span class="smcap">from Edinburgh</span>,” etc., etc.,
etc., who specify that they import their own teas and wines, and deal
both <i>en gros et en petit</i>.</p>

<p>For a good while Jock continued to do business with Nelly Bathgate,
unannoyed, as the honest dame herself, by any other grocery
shop; and indeed how there could be such a thing as another grocery
shop in the whole world besides Nelly’s, was quite incomprehensible to
Jock. But at length the distracting object arose. A larger shop than
Nelly’s, with larger windows, and a larger sign-board, was opened;
the proprietor had a son in Edinburgh with a great wholesale grocer in
Nicolson Street; and was supplied with a great quantity of goods, at
cheap prices, of a more flashy nature than any that had ever before
been dreamt of, smelt, or eaten in the village. Here a strange grocery
article, called pearl ashes, was sold; and being the first time that such
a thing was ever heard of, Innerleithen was just in a ferment about it.
Jock was strongly tempted to give his custom, or rather the custom of
his employers, to this shop; for really Nelly’s customary <i>snap</i> was
growing stale upon his appetite, and he longed to taste the comfits of
the new establishment. This Nelly saw and appreciated; and, to
prevent the defection she feared, Jock’s allowance was forthwith
doubled, and, moreover, occasionally varied by a guerdon of a sweeter
sort. But still Jock hankered after the sweets of that strange forbidden
shop; and, as he passed towards Nelly’s, after a long hungry journey,
could almost have wished himself transformed into one of those yellow
bees which buzzed about in noisy enjoyment within the window and
show-glasses of the new grocer,—creatures which, to his mind, appeared
to pass the most delightful and enviable life. It is certainly
much to Jock’s credit, that, even under all these temptations, and
though he had frequently a whole sixpence to dispose of in eight or ten
different small articles, and, no less, though he had no security engaged
for intromissions, so that the whole business was nothing but a question
of character,—yea, in not so much as a farthing was he ever found
wanting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">{11}</span></p>

<p>Nelly continued to be a good friend to Jock, and Jock adhered as
stoutly to Nelly; but it was frequently observed by those who were
curious in his mad humours, that his happy conquest over the love of
comfits was not accomplished and preserved without many struggles
between his instinctive honesty and the old Adam of his inner man.
For instance, after having made all his purchases at Mrs. Bathgate’s,
when he found only a single solitary farthing remain in his hand,
which was to be his faithful companion all the way back to Gilmanscleugh,
how forcibly it must have struck his foolish mind, that, by
means of the new grocer, he had it in his power to improve his
society a thousand-fold, by the simple and easy, though almost-as-good-as-alchymical
process of converting its base brazen form into a
mass of gilt gingerbread. Such a temptation might have staggered
St. Anthony himself, and was certainly far too much for poor Jock’s
humble powers of self-denial. In this dreadful emergency, his only
means of safety lay in flight; and so it was observed by his rustic
friends, on such occasions, that, as soon as he was fairly clear of Nelly’s
door, he commenced a sort of headlong trot, as if for the purpose of
confounding all dishonourable thoughts in his mind, and ran with all
his might out of the village, without looking once aside; for if he had
trusted his eye with but one glance at that neat whitewashed window
of four panes, where two biscuits, four gingerbread cakes, a small blue
bottle of white caraways, and a variety of other nondescript articles
of village confectionery displayed their modest yet irresistible allurements,
he had been gone!</p>

<p>There is one species of employment in which Jock always displays
the utmost willingness to be engaged. It must be understood, that,
like many sounder men, he is a great admirer of the fair sex. He
exhibits an almost chivalrous devotion to their cause, and takes great
pleasure in serving them. Any little commission with which they may
please to honour him, he executes with alacrity, and his own expression
is that he would “jump Tweed, or dive the Wheel (a deep eddy in
Tweed), for their sakes.” He requires no reward for his services, but,
like a true knight, begs only to kiss the hand of his fair employer, and
is satisfied. It may be observed, that he is at all times fond of saluting
the hands of ladies that will permit him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">{12}</span></p>

<p>The author of “Waverley” has described Davie Gellatley as dressed
in a grey jerkin, with scarlet cuffs, and slashed sleeves, showing a scarlet
lining, a livery with which the Baron of Bradwardine indued him, in
consideration of his services and character. Daft Jock Grey has at no
period of his life exhibited so much personal magnificence. His usual
dress is a rather shabby suit of hodden grey, with <i>ridge and furrow</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
stockings; and the utmost extent of his finery is a pair of broad red
garters, bound neatly below the knee-strings of his nether garments, of
which, however, he is probably more vain than ever belted knight was
of the royal garter. But waiving the matter of dress, their discrepance
in which is purely accidental, the resemblance is complete in every other
respect. The face, mien, and gestures are exactly the same. Jock
walks with all that swing of the body and arms, that abstracted air and
sauntering pace, which figure in the description of Davie (“Waverley,”
vol i. chap. ix.), and which, it may indeed be said, are peculiar to the
whole genus and body of Scottish madmen. Jock’s face is equally
handsome in its outline with that given to the fool of Tully-Veolan,
and is no less distinguished by “that wild, unsettled, and irregular expression,
which indicated neither idiocy nor insanity, but something
resembling a compound of both, where the simplicity of the fool was
mixed with the extravagance of a crazed imagination.” Add to this
happy picture the prosaic and somewhat unromantic circumstance of a
pair of buck-teeth, and the reader has our friend Jock to a single
feature.</p>

<p>The Highland madman is described by his pedantic patron, to be
“a poor simpleton, neither <i>fatuus nec naturaliter idiota</i>, as is expressed
in the brieves of furiosity, but simply a cracked-brained knave, who
could execute any commission that jumped with his own humour, and
made his folly a plea for avoiding every other.” This entirely agrees
with the character of Jock, who is thought by many to possess much
good common sense, and whose talents of music and mimicry point
him out as at least ingenious. Yet to us it appears, that all Jock’s
qualifications, ingenious as they may be, are nothing but indications of
a weak mind. His great musical and mimetic powers, his talent and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">{13}</span>
willingness of errand-going, his cunning and his excessive devotion to
the humours and fancies of the fair sex, are mere caricatures of the
same dispositions and talents in other men, and point out all such
qualifications, when found in the best and wisest characters, as marks
of fatuity and weakness. Where, for instance, was the perfection of
musical genius ever found accompanied with a good understanding?
Are not porters and chairman the smallest-minded among mankind?
Is not cunning the lowest of the human faculties, and always found
most active in the illiberal mind? And what lady’s man, what <i>cavaliere
serviente</i>, what squire of dames, what man of drawing-rooms and
boudoirs, ever yet exhibited the least trace of greatness or nobility of
intellect? Jock, who has all these qualifications in himself, may be
considered as outweighing at least four other men who severally possess
them.</p>

<p>Like Davie Gellatley, Jock “is in good earnest the half-crazed
simpleton which he appears to be, and incapable of any steady
exertion. He has just so much wild wit as saves him from the imputation
of insanity, warm affections, a prodigious memory, and an ear for
music.” This latter quality is a point of resemblance which puts all
question of their identity past the possibility of doubt. Davie it must be
well remembered by the readers of “Waverley,” is there represented as
constantly singing wild scraps of ancient songs and ballads, which, by a
beautiful fiction of the author, he is said to have received in legacy from
a poetical brother who died in a decline some years before. His conversation
was in general carried on by means of these, to the great annoyance
of young Waverley, and such as, like him, did not comprehend the
strange metaphorical meaning of his replies and allusions. Now, Jock’s
principal talent and means of subsistence are vested in his singular and
minstrel-like powers of song, there being few of our national melodies
of which he cannot chaunt forth a verse, as the occasion may suggest to
his memory. He never fails to be a welcome guest with all the farmers
he may chance to visit,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on account of his faculties of entertaining them
with the tender or warlike ditties of the Border, or the more smart and
vulgar songs of the modern world. It is to be remarked, that his style<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">{14}</span>
of singing, like the styles of all other great geniuses in the fine arts, is
entirely his own. Sometimes his voice soars to the ecstasy of the
highest, and sometimes descends to the melancholious grunt of the
lowest pitch; while ever and anon he throws certain wild and beautiful
variations into both the words and the music, <i>ad libitum</i>, which
altogether stamp his performances with a character of the most perfect
originality. He generally sings very much through his nose, especially
in humorous songs; and, from his making a curious hiss, or twang,
on setting off into a melody, one might almost think that he employs
his notorious buck-teeth in the capacity of what musicians term a <i>pitchfork</i>.</p>

<p>Jock, by means of his singing powers, was one of the first who circulated
the rising fame of his countryman, the Ettrick Shepherd, many
of whose early songs he committed to memory, and sung publicly over
all the country round. One beginning, “Oh Shepherd, the weather
is misty and changing,” and the well known lyric of “Love is like a
dizziness,” besides being the first poetical efforts of their ingenious and
wonderful author, were the earliest of Jock Gray’s favourite songs, and
perhaps became the chief means of setting him up in the trade of a
wandering minstrel. We have seen him standing upon a <i>dees stane</i> in
the street of Peebles, entertaining upwards of a hundred people with
the latter ludicrous ditty; and many a well-told penny has he made it
squeeze from the iron purses of the inhabitants of that worthy town,
“albeit unused to the <i>opening</i> mood.”</p>

<p>In singing the “Ewe-buchts, Marion,” it is remarkable that he adds
a chorus which is not found in any printed edition of the song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Come round about the Merry-knowes, my Marion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Come round about the Merry-knowes wi’ me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Come round about the Merry-knowes, my Marion,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">For Whitsled is lying lea.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Whitsled is a farm in the parish of Ashkirk, county of Selkirk, lying
upon the water of Ale; and Merry-knowes is the name of a particular
spot in the farm. This circumstance is certainly important enough to
deserve the attention of those who make Scottish song a study and
object of collection; as the verse, if authentic, would go far to prove
the locality of the “Ewe-buchts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">{15}</span></p>

<p>In addition to his talent as a musician, Jock can also boast of a
supplementary one, by means of which, whenever memory fails in his
songs, he can supply, <i>currente voce</i>, all incidental deficiencies. He is
not only a wit and a musician, but also a <i>poet</i>! He has composed
several songs, which by no means want admirers in the country,
though the most of them scarcely deserve the praise of even mediocrity.
Indeed his poetical talents are of no higher order than what the author
of an excellent article in the “Edinburgh Annual Register” happily
terms “wonderfully well considering”; and seem to be admired by his
rustic friends only on the benevolent principle of “where little has
been given, let little be required.”</p>

<p>He has, however, another most remarkable gift, which the author of
“Waverley” has entirely rejected in conceiving the revised and enlarged
edition of his character,—a wonderful turn for <i>mimicry</i>. His powers
in this art are far, far indeed, from contemptible, though it unfortunately
happens that, like almost all rustic Scottish humorists, he
makes ministers and sacred things his chief and favourite objects. He
attends the preachings of all the ministers that fall within the scope of
his peregrinations, and sometimes brings away whole <i>tenthlies</i> of their
several sermons, which he lays off to any person that desires him, with
a faithfulness of imitation, in tone and gesture, which never fails to convulse
his audience with laughter. He has made himself master of all
the twangs, <i>soughs</i>, wheezes, coughs, <i>snirtles</i>, and bleatings, peculiar to
the various parish ministers twenty miles round; and being himself of
no particular sect, he feels not the least delicacy or compunction for any
single class of divines—all are indiscriminately familiar to the powers
of the universal Jock!</p>

<p>It is remarkable, that though the Scottish peasantry are almost without
exception pious, they never express, so far as we have been able to
discover, the least demur respecting the profanity and irreverence of
this exhibition. The character of the nation may appear anomalous on
this account. But we believe the mystery may be solved by supposing
them so sincerely and unaffectedly devout, in all that concerns the
sentiment of piety, that they do not suspect themselves of any remissness,
when they make the outward circumstances, and even the
ordinances of religion, the subject of wit. It is on this account, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">{16}</span>
in no country, even the most lax in religious feeling, have the matters
of the church been discussed so freely as in Scotland; and nowhere are
there so many jokes and good things about ministers and priests. In
this case the very ministers themselves have been known to listen to
Daft Jock’s mimicries of their neighbours with unqualmed delight,—never
thinking, good souls, that the impartial rascal has just as little
mercy on themselves at the next manse he visits. It is also to be remarked,
that, in thus quizzing the worthy ministers, he does not forget
to practise what the country-people consider a piece of exquisite satire
on the habits of such as <i>read</i> their sermons. Whenever he imitates
any of these degenerate divines, who, by their unpopularity, form quite
a sect by themselves in the country, and are not nearly so much
respected as extempore preachers,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> he must have either a book or a
piece of paper open before him, from which he gravely affects to read
the subject of discourse; and his audience are always trebly delighted
with this species of exhibition. He was once amusing Mrs. C——, the
minister’s wife of Selkirk, with some imitations of the neighbouring
clergymen, when she at last requested him to give her a few words in
the manner of Dr. C——, who being a notorious <i>reader</i>, “Ou, Mem,”
says Jock, “ye maun bring me the Doctor’s Bible, then, and I’ll gie
ye him <i>in style</i>.” She brought the Bible, little suspecting the purpose
for which the wag intended it, when, with the greatest effrontery, he
proceeded to burlesque this unhappy peculiarity of the worthy doctor
in the presence of his own wife.</p>

<p>Jock was always a privileged character in attending all sorts of kirks,
though many ministers, who dreaded a future sufferance under his
relentless caricaturing powers, would have been glad to exclude him.
He never seems to pay any attention to the sermon, or even deigns to
sit down, like other decent Christians, but wanders constantly about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">{17}</span>
from gallery to gallery, upstairs and downstairs. His erratic habit
is not altogether without its use. When he observes any person sleeping
during the sermon, he reaches over to the place, and taps
him gently on the head with his <i>kent</i> till he awake; should he in any
of his future rounds (for he parades as regularly about as a policeman
in a large city) observe the drowsy person repeating the offence, he
gives him a tremendous thwack over the pate; and he increases the
punishment so much at every subsequent offence, that, like the military
punishment for desertion, the third infliction almost amounts to death
itself. A most laughable incident once occurred in —— church, on a
drowsy summer afternoon, when the windows were let down, admitting
and emitting a thousand flies, whose monotonous buzz, joined to the
somniferous snuffle of Dr. ——, would have been fit music for the bedchamber
of Morpheus, even though that honest god was lying ill of the
toothache, the gout, or any other equally <i>woukrife</i> disorder. A bailie,
who had dined, as is usual in most country towns, between sermons,
could not resist the propensity of his nature, and, fairly overpowered,
at last was under the necessity of affronting the preacher to his very
face, by laying down his head upon the book-board; when his capacious,
bald round crown might have been mistaken, at first sight, for
the face of the clock placed in the front of the gallery immediately
below. Jock was soon at him with his stick, and, with great difficulty,
succeeded in rousing him. But the indulgence was too great to be
long resisted, and down again went the bailie’s head. This was not
to be borne. Jock considered his authority sacred, and feared not
either the frowns of elders, nor the more threatening scowls of kirk-officers,
when his duty was to be done. So his arm went forth, and
the <i>kent</i> descended a second time with little reverence upon the offending
sconce; upon which the magistrate started up with an astonished
stare, in which the sentiment of surprise was as completely concentrated
as in the face of the inimitable Mackay, when he cries out,
“Hang a magistrate! My conscience!” The contrast between the
bailie’s stupid and drowsy face, smarting and writhing from the blow,
which Jock had laid on pretty soundly, and the aspect of the <i>natural</i>
himself, who still stood at the head of the pew, shaking his stick, and
looking at the magistrate with an air in which authority, admonition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">{18}</span>
and a threat of further punishment, were strangely mingled, altogether
formed a scene of striking and irresistible burlesque; and while the
Doctor’s customary snuffle was increased to a perfect whimper of
distress, the whole congregation showed in their faces evident symptoms
of everything but the demureness proper to a place of worship.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when in a sitting mood, Jock takes a modest seat on
the pulpit stairs, where there likewise usually roost a number of deaf
old women, who cannot hear in any other part of the church. These
old ladies, whom the reader will remember as the unfortunate persons
that Dominie Sampson sprawled over, in his premature descent from
the pulpit, when he <i>stickit</i> his first preaching, our waggish friend would
endeavour to torment by every means which his knavish humour could
invent. He would tread upon their corns, lean amorously upon their
laps, purloin their <i>specks</i> (spectacles), set them on a false scent after
the psalm, and, sometimes getting behind them, plant his longest and
most serious face over their black cathedral-looking bonnets, like an
owl looking over an ivied wall, while few of the audience could contain
their gravity at the extreme humour of the scene. The fun was sometimes,
as we ourselves have witnessed, not a little enhanced by the old
lady upon whom Jock was practising, turning round, in holy dudgeon,
and dealing the unlucky wag a vengeful thwack across the face with
her heavy <i>octavo</i> Bible. We have also seen a very ludicrous scene take
place, when, on the occasion of a baptism, he refused to come down
from his citadel, and defied all the efforts which James Kerr, the kirk-officer,
made to dislodge him; while the father of the child, waiting
below to present it, stood in the most awkward predicament imaginable,
not daring to venture upon the stairs while Jock kept possession
of them. It is not probable, however, that he would have been so
obstinate on that occasion, if he had not had an ill-will at the preserver
of the peace, for his interrupting him that day in his laudable endeavours
to break the slumbers of certain persons, whose peace (or <i>rest</i>) it
was the peculiar interest of that official to preserve.</p>

<p>We will conclude this sketch of <i>Daft Jock Gray</i> with a stupendous
anecdote, which we fear, however, is not strictly canonical. Jock
once received an affront from his mother, who refused to gratify him
with an extra allowance of bannocks, at a time when he meditated a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">{19}</span>
long journey to a New Year’s Day junketing. Whereupon he seems
to have felt the yearnings of a hermit and a misanthrope within his
breast, and longed to testify to the world how much he both detested
and despised it. He withdrew himself from the society of the cottage,—was
seen to reject the addresses of his old companion and friend the
cat,—and finally, next morning, after tossing an offered cogue of
<i>Scotia’s halesome food</i> into the fire, and breaking two of his mother’s
best and blackest <i>cutty pipes</i>, articles which she held almost in the
esteem of <i>penates</i> or household gods,—off he went, and ascended to
the top of the highest Eildon Hill, at that time covered with deep
snow. There he wreaked out his vengeance in a tremendous and truly
astonishing exploit. He rolled a huge snow-ball, till, in its accumulation,
it became too large for his strength, and then taking it to the
edge of the declivity,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“From Eildon’s proud vermilioned brow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He dashed upon the plains below”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>the ponderous mass; which, increasing rapidly in its descent, became
a perfect avalanche before it reached the plain, and, when there,
seemed like a younger brother of the three Eildons, so that people
thought Michael Scott had resumed his old pranks, and added another
hill to that which he formerly “split in three.” This enormous
conglomeration of snow was found, when it fully melted away through
the course of next summer, to have licked up with its mountain tongue
thirty-five clumps of withered whin bushes, nineteen hares, three
ruined cottages, and a whole encampment of peat-stacks!</p>

<p>The <i>Naturals</i>, or Idiots, of Scotland, of whom the Davie Gellatley
of <i>fictitious</i>, and the Daft Jock Gray of <i>real</i> life, may be considered as
good specimens, form a class of our countrymen which it is our anxious
desire should be kept in remembrance. Many of the anecdotes told of
them are extremely laughable, and we are inclined to prize such things,
on account of the just exhibitions they sometimes afford of genuine
human nature. The sketch we have given, and the anecdotes which
we are about to give, may perhaps be considered valuable on this
account, and also from their connection, moreover, with the manners
of rustic life in the Lowlands of Scotland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">{20}</span></p>
<p><i>Daft Willie Law</i><a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of Kirkaldy was a regular attendant on <i>tent-preachings</i>,
and would scour the country thirty miles round in order to
be present at “<i>an occasion</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> One warm summer day he was attending
the preaching at Abbots Hall, when, being very near-sighted, and
having a very short neck, he stood quite close to “<i>the tent</i>” gaping in
the minister’s face, who, greatly irritated at a number of his hearers
being fast asleep, bawled out, “For shame, Christians, to lie sleeping
there, while the glad tidings of the gospel are sounding in your ears;
and here is Willie Law, a poor idiot, hearing me with great attention!”
“Eh go! sir, that’s true,” says Willie; “but if I hadna been
a puir idiot, I would have been sleeping too!”</p>

<p>The late John Berry, Esq., of Wester Bogie, was married to a
distant relation of Daft Willie, upon which account the poor fellow
used a little more freedom with that gentleman than with any other
who was in the habit of noticing him. Meeting Mr. Berry one day in
Kirkaldy, he cries, “God bless you, Mr. Berry! gie’s a bawbee! gie’s
a bawbee!” “There, Willie,” says Mr. Berry, giving him what he
thought a halfpenny, but which he immediately saw was a shilling.
“That’s no a gude bawbee, Willie,” continues he; “gie me’t back,
and I’ll gie ye anither ane for’t.” “Na, na,” quoth Willie, “it sets
Daft Willie Law far better to put away an ill bawbee than it wad do
you, Mr. Berry.” “Ay, but Willie, if ye dinna gie me’t back, I’ll
never gie ye anither ane.” “Deil ma care,” says the wag, “it’ll be
lang or I get ither four-and-twenty frae ye!”</p>

<p>Willie was descended from an ancient Scottish family, and nearly
related to John Law of Lauriston, the celebrated financier of France.
On that account he was often spoken to and noticed by gentlemen of
distinction; and he wished always to appear on the most intimate
terms with the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood. Posting one
day through Kirkcaldy with more than ordinary speed, he was met by
Mr. Oswald of Dunnikier, who asked him where he was going in such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">{21}</span>
a hurry. “I’m gaun to my cousin Lord Elgin’s burial.” “Your
cousin Lord Elgin’s burial, you fool! Lord Elgin’s not dead!” “Ah,
deil may care,” quoth Willie; “there’s sax doctors out o’ Embro’ at
him, and they’ll hae him dead afore I win forat!”</p>

<p>Of <i>Matthew Cathie</i>, an East Lothian idiot, numerous characteristic
anecdotes are related. He lives by begging in the town of North
Berwick, and is well treated by the people there, on account of his
extreme inoffensiveness. Like Daft Jock Gray, he is fond of going
into churches, where his appearance does not fail to set the people
a-staring. On one occasion the minister, pointing to Matthew, said,
“That person must be put out before we can proceed.” Matthew,
hearing this, exclaimed, “Put him out wha likes, I’ll hae nae hand
in’t!” Another time, the minister said, “Matthew must be put out!”
when Matthew got up and replied, “Oh! Geordie, man, ye needna
fash—Matthew can gang out himsel’!”</p>

<p>The Earl of Wemyss, walking one day, found his fool, Willie
Howison, asleep upon the ground, and, rousing him, asked what he
had been dreaming about. “Ou, my lord,” says Willie, “I dreamed
that I was in hell!” “Ay, Willie, and pray what did ye observe
there?” “Ou, my lord, it’s just there as it’s here—the grit folk’s
ta’en <i>farrest ben</i>!”</p>

<p>Selkirkshire boasts of several highly amusing idiots, all of whom
John Gray once made the subject of a song, in which each of them
received some complimentary mention. Himself, <i>Davie o’ the Inch</i>,
<i>Caleb and Robbie Scott</i>, and <i>Jamie Renwick</i>, are the chief heroes.
Caleb, a very stupid natural, was once engaged by a troop of wandering
showfolks to personate the character of an orang-outang at a
Melrose fair; the regular orang-outang of the establishment having
recently left his keepers in the lurch, by marrying a widow in Berwick,
which enabled him to give up business, and retire to the shades of
domestic privity. Caleb performed very well, and, being appropriately
tarred and feathered, looked the part to perfection. Amateurship
alone would have soon reconciled him to be an orang-outang all the
rest of his life, and to have left Selkirkshire behind; for, according to
his own account, he had nothing to do but hold his tongue, and sit
munching apples all day long. But his stars had not destined him for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">{22}</span>
so enviable a life of enjoyment. A drunken farmer coming in to see
“the wild man of the woods,” out of pure mischief gave Caleb a lash
across the shoulders with his whip, when the poor fellow, roaring out
in his natural voice, a mortifying <i>denouement</i> took place; the showfolks
were affronted and hissed out of the town, and Caleb was turned
off at a moment’s notice, with all his blushing honours thick upon
him!</p>

<p><i>Jamie Renwick</i> has more sense and better perceptions than Caleb
Scott, but he is much more intractable and mischievous. He is a tall,
stout, wild-looking fellow, and might perhaps make as good a hyena
as Caleb made an orang-outang. Once, being upon an excursion along
with Jock Gray, they came to a farmhouse, and, in default of better
accommodation, were lodged in the barn. They did not like this
treatment at all, and Jock, in particular, was so irritated, that he
would not rest, but got up and walked about, amusing himself with
some of his wildest and most sonorous melodies. This, of course,
annoyed his companion, who, being inclined to sleep, was making the
best he could of a blanket and a bundle of straw. “Come to your
bed, ye skirlin’ deevil!” cries Jamie; “I canna get a wink o’ sleep
for ye: I daursay the folk will think us daft! Od, if ye dinna come
and lie down this instant, I’ll rise and <i>bring ye to your senses</i> wi’ my
rung!” “Faith,” says Jock, “if ye do <i>that</i>, it will be mair than ony
ither body has ever been able to do!” It will be remembered that
even the minister of Yarrow himself failed in accomplishing this consummation
so devoutly to be wished.</p>

<p>The following anecdote, from Colonel Stewart’s work on the Highlands,
displays a strange instance of mingled sagacity and fidelity in a
Celtic madman; and has, we have no doubt, been made use of in the
author of “Waverley’s” examples of the fidelity of Davie Gellatley,
as exerted in behalf of his unfortunate patron on similar occasions.</p>

<p>“In the years 1746 and 1747, some of the gentlemen ‘<i>who had been
out</i>’ in the rebellion were occasionally concealed in a deep woody den
near my grandfather’s house. A poor half-witted creature, brought up
about the house, was, along with many others, intrusted with the secret
of their concealment, and employed in supplying them with necessaries.
It was supposed that when the troops came round on their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">{23}</span>
usual searches, they would not imagine that he could be intrusted with
so important a secret, and, consequently, no questions would be asked.
One day two ladies, friends of the gentlemen, wished to visit them in
their cave, and asked Jamie Forbes to show them the way. Seeing
that they came from the house, and judging from their manner that
they were friends, he did not object to their request, and walked away
before them. When they had proceeded a short way, one of the
ladies offered him five shillings. The instant he saw the money, he
put his hands behind his back, and seemed to lose all recollection.
‘He did not know what they wanted: he never saw the gentlemen,
and knew nothing of them;’ and, turning away, walked in a quite
contrary direction. When questioned afterwards why he ran away
from the ladies, he answered, that when they had offered him such a
sum (five shillings was of some value seventy years ago, and would
have bought two sheep in the Highlands), he suspected they had no
good intention, and that their fine clothes and fair words were meant
to entrap the gentlemen.”</p>


<h3 title="RORY DALL, THE HARPER.">RORY DALL, THE HARPER.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></h3>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> allusion is made to this celebrated musician in the description of
Flora Mac-Ivor’s performance upon the harp in the Highland glen.
“Two paces back stood Cathleen, holding a small Scottish harp, the
use of which had been taught her by Rory Dall, one of the last
harpers of the Western Islands.” (“Wav.,” vol. i. p. 338.) <i>Roderick
Morison</i>, called <i>Dall</i> on account of his blindness, lived in Queen
Anne’s time, in the double capacity of harper and bard to the family
of Macleod of Macleod. Many of his songs and poems are still
repeated by his countrymen.</p>


<h3>“CLAW FOR CLAW, AS CONAN SAID TO SATAN.”</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Highlanders prepared for Prestonpans (“Wav.,” vol. ii.
p. 289), Mrs. Flockhart, in great distress about the departure of her
lodgers, asks Ensign Maccombich if he would “actually face thae<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">{24}</span>
tearing, swearing chields, the dragoons?” “Claw for claw,” cries
the courageous Highlander, “and the devil take the shortest nails!”
This is an old Gaelic proverb. <i>Conan</i> was one of Fingal’s heroes—rash,
turbulent, and brave. One of his unearthly exploits is said to
have led him to Iurna, or Cold Island (similar to the Den of Hela of
Scandinavian mythology), a place only inhabited by infernal beings.
On Conan’s departure from the island, one of its demons struck him a
blow, which he instantly returned. This outrage upon immortals was
fearfully retaliated, by a whole legion setting upon poor Conan. But
the warrior was not daunted; and exclaiming, “Claw for claw, and
the devil take the shortest nails!” fought out the battle, and, it is
said, ultimately came off victorious.</p>


<h3>TULLY-VEOLAN.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Traquair House.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tully-Veolan</span> finds a striking counterpart in Traquair House, in
Peebles-shire, the seat of the noble family whose name it bears. The
aspect of the gateway, avenue, and house itself, is precisely that of the
semi-Gothic, bear-guarded mansion of Bradwardine. It is true that, in
place of the multitudinous representations of the bear, so profusely
scattered around Tully-Veolan, we have here only a single pair, which
adorn the gate at the head of the avenue: and that the avenue itself
cannot pretend to match the broad continuous shade through which
Waverley approached the Highland castle; and also that several other
important features are wanting to complete the resemblance;—yet, if
we be not altogether imposed upon by fancy, there is a likeness sufficiently
strong to support the idea that this scene formed the original
<i>study</i> of the more finished and bold-featured picture of the novelist.
Traquair House was finished in the reign of Charles I. by the first
Earl, who was lord high treasurer of Scotland at that period. This
date corresponds with that assigned to Tully-Veolan, which, says the
author, was built when architects had not yet abandoned the castellated
style peculiar to the preceding warlike ages, nor yet acquired the art of
constructing a baronial mansion without a view to defence.</p>

<p>It is worthy of remark, that the Earl of Traquair is the only Scottish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">{25}</span>
nobleman, besides the Earl of Newburgh, who still adheres to the
Romish faith:<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and that his antique and interesting house strongly
resembles, in its <i>internal economy and appearance</i>, Glenallan Castle,
described in the “Antiquary.”</p>

<p>Among the illustrative vignettes prefixed to a late edition of the
author of “Waverley’s” works, a view of Craig Crook Castle, near
Edinburgh, is given for Tully-Veolan; and, to complete the <i>vraisemblance</i>,
several bears have been added to the scene. It is only
necessary to assert, in general, that these bears only exist in the imagination
of the artist, and that no place has less resemblance to the
Tully-Veolan of “Waverley” than Craig Crook, which is a small <i>single</i>
house, in a bare situation, more like the mansion of poor Laird Dumbiedykes
than the castle of a powerful feudal baron.</p>


<h3>THE BODACH GLAS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> original of the <i>Bodach Glas</i>, whose appearance proved so portentous
to the family of the Mac-Ivors, may probably be traced to a
legend current in the ancient family of Maclaine of Lochbuy, in the
island of Mull, noticed by Sir Walter Scott in a note to his “Lady of
the Lake.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The popular tradition is, that whenever any person
descended of that family is near death, the spirit of one of them, who
was slain in battle, gives notice of the approaching event. There is
this difference between the <i>Bodach Glas</i> and him, that the former
appeared on these solemn occasions only to the chief of the house of
Mac-Ivor, whereas the latter never misses an individual descended of
the family of Lochbuy, however obscure, or in whatever part of the
world he may be.</p>

<p>The manner of his showing himself is sometimes different, but he
uniformly appears on horseback. Both the horse and himself seem to
be of a very diminutive size, particularly the head of the rider, from
which circumstance he goes under the appellation of “<i>Eoghan a chinn
bhig</i>,” or “<i>Hugh of the little head</i>.” Sometimes he is heard riding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">{26}</span>
furiously round the house where the person is about to die, with an
extraordinary noise, like the rattling of iron chains. At other times
he is discovered with his horse’s head nearly thrust in at a door or
window; and, on such occasions, whenever observed, he gallops off in
the manner already described, the hooves of his steed striking fire from
the flinty rocks. The effects of such a visit on the inmates of the
dwelling may be easily conceived when it is considered that it was
viewed as an infallible prognostication of approaching death—an event
at which the stoutest heart must recoil, when the certainty is placed
before him of his hours being numbered. Like his brother spirits, he
seems destined to perform his melancholy rounds amidst nocturnal
darkness, the horrors of which have a natural tendency to increase the
consternation of a scene in itself sufficiently appalling.</p>

<p>The origin of the tradition is involved in the obscurity of antiquity.
It is related of him that, on the eve of a battle in which he was to be
engaged, a weird woman prophesied to him, that if his wife (who was
a daughter of Macdougall of Lorn), on the morning when he was to set
out on his expedition, had his breakfast prepared before he was ready
for it, good fortune would betide him; if, on the other hand, he had to
call for his breakfast, he would lose his life in the conflict. It seems
he was not blest with an affectionate spouse; for, on the morning in
question, after waiting a considerable time, he had at last to call for
his breakfast, not, however, without upbraiding his wife, by informing
her of what was to be the consequence of her want of attention. The
presentiment that he was to fall may have contributed to the fulfilment
of the prophecy, which was accomplished as a matter of course. This
part of the story probably refers to one of the Maclaines of Lochbuy,
who was married to a daughter of Macdougall of Lorn, and who, with
his two eldest sons, was killed in a feud with their neighbours, the
Macleans of Duart, which had nearly proved fatal to the family of
Lochbuy. This happened in the reign of King James IV.</p>

<p>It has not come to our knowledge for what cause the penance was
imposed on <i>Eoghan a chinn bhig</i> of giving warning to all his clan of
their latter end—whether for deeds done in this life, or whether (as
some people imagine that departed spirits act as guardian angels to the
living) he is thus permitted to show his regard for his friends by visiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">{27}</span>
them in their last moments, to prepare them for another world. The
latter would appear to be the most probable, from a circumstance
reported of him, which seems rather at variance with the general
character of a harbinger of death. It is said that he took a great fancy
to a near relation of the family of Lochbuy (called, by way of patronymic,
John M‘Charles), to whom he paid frequent visits, and communicated
several particulars respecting the future fate of the family.
Whenever he wished an interview with his favourite, he would come to
his door, from which he would not stir till John M‘Charles came out;
when he would pull him up behind him on his Pegasus, and ride all
night over hills, rocks, woods, and wilds, at the same time conversing
with him familiarly of several events that were to happen in the
Lochbuy family, one of which is said to have been accomplished, about
forty years ago, according to his prediction.</p>

<p>This tiny personage, though light of limb, has the reputation of
being, like all other unearthly beings, endued with supernatural
strength, of which his exploits with John M‘Charles afford an instance.
Not many years ago, a man in Mull, when returning home about dusk,
perceived a person on horseback coming towards him. Supposing it
might be some person whom he knew, he went up to speak to him;
but the horseman seemed determined to pass on without noticing him.
Thinking he observed something remarkable in the appearance of the
rider, he approached close to him, when he was unexpectedly seized by
the collar, and forcibly dragged about a quarter of a mile by the
stranger, who at last abandoned his hold, after several ineffectual
attempts to place his terrified victim behind him, which, being a powerful
man, he successfully resisted. He was, however, so much bruised
in the scuffle, that it was with difficulty he could make his way home,
although he had only about half a mile to go. He immediately took to
his bed, which he did not leave for some days, his friends wondering
all the time what could be the matter with him. It was not until he
told the story, as we have related it, that the adventure was known.
And as, after the strictest inquiry, it could not be ascertained that any
person on horseback had passed that way on the evening on which it
took place, it was, by the unanimous voice of all the seers and old
wives in the neighbourhood, laid down as an incontrovertible proposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">{28}</span>
that the equestrian stranger could be no other than “<i>Eoghan a
chinn bhig</i>.”</p>

<p>In whatever way the tradition originated, certain it is that, at one
time, it was very generally, if not universally, received over the island
of Mull and adjacent parts. Like other superstitions of a similar
nature, it has gradually given way to the more enlightened ideas of
modern times, and the belief is now confined to the vulgar.</p>

<h3>CURIOUS PARTICULARS OF SIR ROBERT MAXWELL OF ORCHARDSTON.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Groundwork of the Novel.</i>)</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe7_1875" id="i_p_029">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_029.jpg" alt="“S" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">ir</span> Robert Maxwell of Orchardston, in the county of
Galloway, was the descendant of an ancient Roman Catholic
family of title in the south of Scotland. He was the only child of a
religious and bigoted recluse, who sent him, while yet very young, to a
college of Jesuits in Flanders, for education—the paternal estate being,
in the meantime, wholly managed by the boy’s uncle, the brother of the
devotee, to whom he resigned the guardianship of the property, in
order that he might employ the remainder of his days exclusively in acts
of devotion. In the family of Orchardston, as, indeed, in most great
families of that day, the younger branches were but ill provided for,
and looked to the inheritor of the family estate alone for the means
of supporting their rank in society: the liberal professions and the
employments of trade were still considered somewhat dishonourable;
and the unfortunate junior, nursed with inflated ideas of consequence
and rank, was doomed in after-life to exercise the servility and
experience the mortification of an humble dependant. In this case,
the culpable negligence of the father had transferred the entire management
of a large estate to his younger brother, who was so delighted in
the possession, that he resolved to retain it, to the exclusion of the
rightful heir. He consequently circulated a report that the boy was
dead; and on the death of the old baronet, which took place about this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">{30}</span>
period, he laid claim to the title and estate. In the meantime, our
young hero was suffering (very reluctantly) the severe discipline of the
Jesuits’ college, his expenses being defrayed by occasional supplies
sent him by his uncle, which were represented to him as the bounties
of the college—a story which he could not discredit, as he had been
placed there at an age too young to know distinctly either who he was
or whence he came. He was intelligent and docile; and was deemed
of sufficient capacity to become hereafter one of their own learned
body, with which view he was educated. When at the age of sixteen,
he found the discipline and austerities of a monastic life so ill suited to
his inclination, that, on a trivial dispute with the superior of his college,
he ran away, and enlisted himself in a French marching regiment. In
this situation he sustained all the hardships of hunger, long marches,
and incessant alarms; and, as it was in the hottest part of the war
between France and England, about the year 1743, it may easily be
imagined that his situation was by no means enviable. He fought as a
foot-soldier at the battle of Dettingen; he was also at the battle of
Fontenoy; and landed, as an ensign in the French troops, at Murray
Frith, during the rebellion of 1745. He joined the rebels a little before
the battle of Prestonpans, marched with them to Derby, and retreated
with them to Scotland. He was wounded at the battle of Culloden,
and fled with a few friends to the woods of Lochaber, where he remained
the greater part of the summer 1746, living upon the roots of
trees, goats’ milk, and the oatmeal and water of such peasants as he
durst confide in. Knowing, however, that it would be impossible to
continue this course of life during the winter, he began to devise means
of effecting his return to France—perfectly unconscious that, in the
country where he was suffering all the miseries of an outcast criminal,
he was entitled to the possession of an ample estate and title. His
scheme was to gain the coast of Galloway, where he hoped to get on
board some smuggling vessel to the Isle of Man, and from thence to
France. The hardships which he suffered in the prosecution of this
plan would require a volume in their description. He crept through
by-ways by night, and was forced to lie concealed among rocks and
woods during the day. He was reduced almost to a state of nudity,
and his food was obtained from the poorest peasants, in whom only he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">{31}</span>
could confide. Of this scanty subsistence he was sometimes for days
deprived; and, to complete his misfortunes, he was, after having
walked barefooted over rocks, briars, and unfrequented places, at
length discovered, seized, and carried before a magistrate near Dumfries.
As his name was Maxwell, which he did not attempt to conceal,
he would have suffered as a rebel, had not his commission as a French
officer been found in the lining of his tattered coat, which entitled him
to the treatment of a prisoner of war. This privilege, however, only
extended to the preservation of his life. He was confined in a paved
stone dungeon so long, that he had amused himself by giving names to
each stone which composed the pavement, and which, in after-life,
he took great pleasure in relating and pointing out to his friends. An
old woman, who had been his nurse in childhood, was at this time
living in Dumfries, where he was a prisoner; and having accidentally
seen him, and becoming acquainted with his name, apparent age, etc.,
felt an assurance that he was the rightful Sir Robert Maxwell. The
indissoluble attachment of the lower orders in Scotland to their chiefs
is well known; and, impelled by this feeling, this old and faithful
domestic attended him with almost maternal affection, administering
liberally to his distresses. After an interview of some weeks, she made
him acquainted with her suspicion, and begged leave to examine a
mark which she remembered upon his body. This proof also concurring,
she became outrageous with joy, and ran about the streets proclaiming
the discovery she had made. This rumour reaching the ears
of the magistrates, inquiry was made, the proofs were examined, and
it soon became the general opinion that he was the son of the old
baronet of Orchardston. The estate lay but a few miles from Dumfries;
and the unlawful possessor being a man of considerable power,
and of a most vindictive disposition, most people, whatever might be
their private opinion, were cautious in espousing the cause of this disinherited
and distressed orphan. One gentleman, however, was found,
who, to his eternal honour, took him by the hand. A Mr. Gowdy
procured his release from prison, took him to his own house, clothed
him agreeably to his rank, and enabled him to commence an action
against his uncle. The latter was not inactive in the defence of his
crime, and took every pains to prove his nephew to be an impostor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">{32}</span>
Chagrin and a consciousness of guilt, however, put an end to his
existence before the cause came to a hearing; and Sir Robert was at
length put into possession of an estate worth upwards of ten thousand
pounds a year. He now began to display those qualities and abilities
which had been but faintly perceptible in his former station. He now
discovered an ingenuous mind, an intellect at once vigorous and refined,
and manners the most elegant and polished. His society was courted
by all the neighbouring gentry; and, in the course of time he married
a Miss Maclellan, a near relation of the family of Lord Kirkcudbright;
with this lady he lived in the most perfect happiness for many years.
He joined in the prevalent practice of farming his own estate, and built
a very elegant house on an eminence overlooking the Nith. An imprudent
speculation in the bank of Ayr, however, compelled him to
abandon the seat of his ancestors. He had reserved a small pittance,
on which he and his lady lived the latter part of their days. This
calamity he bore as became a man familiar with misfortune; and he
continued the same worthy open-hearted character he had ever been.
The reduction of his fortune served only to redouble the kindness and
cordiality of his friends. He died suddenly in September, 1786, whilst
on the road to visit one of them—the Earl of Selkirk. He left behind
him no issue; but his name is still remembered with ardent attachment.”—<i>New
Monthly Magazine, June, 1819.</i></p>


<h3>ANDREW CROSBIE, ESQ.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Counsellor Pleydell.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> feel no little pleasure in presenting the original of a character so
important as the facetious Pleydell. He is understood to be the representative
of Mr. Andrew Crosbie, who flourished at the head of the
Scottish bar about the period referred to in the novel. Many circumstances
conspire to identify him with the lawyer of the novel. Their
eminence in their profession was equally respectable; their habits of
frequenting taverns and High Jinks parties on Saturday nights was the
same, and both were remarkable for that antique politeness of manner
so characteristic of old Scottish gentlemen. It may be allowed that
Pleydell is one of the characters most nearly approaching to <i>generic</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">{33}</span>
that we have attempted to identify with real life; but it is nevertheless
so strenuously asserted by all who have any recollection of Mr. Crosbie,
that Pleydell resembles <i>him in particular</i>, that we feel no hesitation in
assigning him as the only true specific original. We therefore lay the
following simple facts before the public, and leave the judicious reader
to his own discrimination.</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie was in the prime of life about the middle of the last
century, and, from that period till the year 1780, enjoyed the highest
reputation in his profession. He came of a respectable family in the
county of Galloway—the district, the reader will remember, in which
the principal scenes of the novel are laid, and probably the shire
of which Paulus Pleydell, Esq., is represented (vol. ii. chap, xvi.) as
having been, at an early period of his life, the sheriff-depute.</p>

<p>The residence of Mr. Crosbie, in the early periods of his practice,
exactly coincides with that of Pleydell, whom, if we recollect rightly,
Colonel Mannering found in a dark close on the north side of the High
Street, several storeys up a narrow common stair. Mr. Crosbie lived
first in Lady Stair’s Close, a steep alley on the north side of the Lawnmarket;
afterwards in the Advocate’s Close, in the Luckenbooths;
and finally in a self-contained and well-built house of his own, at the
foot of Allan’s Close, still standing, and lately inhabited by Richard
Cleghorn, Esq., Solicitor before the Supreme Courts. All these
various residences are upon the north side of the High Street, and the
two first answer particularly to the description in the novel. The last
is otherwise remarkable as being situated exactly behind and in view of
the innermost penetralia of Mr. Constable’s great publishing warehouse,<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>—the
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> in which Captain Clutterbuck found
the <i>Eidolon</i> of the Author of “Waverley,” so well described in the introduction
to “Nigel.”</p>

<p>At the period when Mr. Crosbie flourished, all the advocates and
judges of the day dwelt in those obscure <i>wynds</i> or alleys leading down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">{34}</span>
from the High Street, which, since the erection of the New Town, have
been chiefly inhabited by the lower classes of society. The greater
part, for the sake of convenience, lived in the lanes nearest to the
Parliament House—such as the Advocate’s Close, Writer’s Court,
Lady Stair’s Close, the West Bow, the <i>Back Stairs</i>, the President’s
Stairs in the Parliament Close, and the tenements around the Mealmarket.
In these dense and insalubrious obscurities they possessed
what were then the best houses in Edinburgh, and which were considered
as such till the erection of Brown’s Square and the contiguous
suburbs, about the beginning of the last king’s reign, when the lawyers
were found the first to remove to better and more extensive accommodations,
being then, as now, the leading and most opulent class of
Edinburgh population. This change is fully pointed out in “Redgauntlet,”
where a writer to the signet is represented as removing from
the Luckenbooths to Brown’s Square about the time specified—which
personage, disguised under the name of Saunders Fairford, we have no
doubt was designed for Sir Walter Scott’s own father, a practitioner of
the same rank, who then removed from the Old Town to a house at
the head of the College Wynd, in which his distinguished son, the
<i>Alan Fairford</i> of the romance, was born and educated.</p>

<p>Living as they did so near the Parliament House, it was the custom
of both advocates and senators to have their wigs dressed at home, and
to go to court with their gowns indued, their wigs in full puff, and
each with his cocked hat under his arm.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> About nine in the morning,
the various avenues to the Parliament Square used to be crowded with
such figures. In particular, Mr. Crosbie was remarkable for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">{35}</span>
elegance of his figure, as, like his brethren, he emerged from the
profundity of his alley into the open street. While he walked at a
deliberate pace across the way, there could not be seen among all the
throng a more elegant figure. He exhibited at once the dignity of the
counsellor high at the bar and the gracefulness of the perfect gentleman.
He frequently walked without a gown, when the fineness of
his personal appearance was the more remarkable. His dress was
usually a black suit, silk stockings, clear shoes, with gold or silver
buckles. Sometimes the suit was of rich black velvet.</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie, with all the advantages of a pleasing exterior, possessed
the more solid qualifications of a vigorous intellect, a refined taste, and
an eloquence that has never since been equalled at the bar. His
integrity as a counsel could only be surpassed by his abilities as a
pleader. In the first capacity, his acute judgment and great legal
knowledge had long placed him in the highest rank. In the second,
his thorough and confident acquaintance with the law of his case, his
beautiful style of language, all “the pomp and circumstance” of
matchless eloquence, commanded the attention of the bench in no
ordinary degree; and while his talents did all that could be done in
respect of moving the court, the excelling beauty of his oratory attracted
immense crowds of admirers, whose sole disinterested object was to
hear him.</p>

<p>It is recorded of him that he was one day particularly brilliant—so
brilliant as even to surprise his usual audience, the imperturbable Lords
themselves. What rendered the circumstance more wonderful was,
that the case happened to be extremely dull, common-place and
uninteresting. The secret history of the matter was to the following
effect:—A facetious contemporary, and intimate friend of Mr. Crosbie,
the celebrated Lord Gardenstone, in the course of a walk from Morningside,
where he resided, fell into conversation with a farmer, who was
going to Edinburgh in order to hear his cause pled that forenoon by
Mr. Crosbie. The senator, who was a very homely and rather eccentric
personage, on being made acquainted with the man’s business,
directed him to procure a dozen or two farthings at a snuff-shop in the
Grassmarket—to wrap them separately up in white paper, under the
disguise of guineas—and to present them to his counsel as fees, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">{36}</span>
occasion served. The case was called: Mr. Crosbie rose; but his
heart not happening to be particularly engaged, he did not by any
means exert the utmost of his powers. The treacherous client, however,
kept close behind his back, and ever and anon, as he perceived
Mr. C. bringing his voice to a cadence, for the purpose of closing the
argument, slipped the other farthing into his hand. The repeated
application of this silent encouragement so far stimulated the advocate,
that, in the end, he became truly eloquent—strained every nerve of his
soul in grateful zeal for the interests of so good a client—and, precisely
at the fourteenth farthing, gained the cause. The <i>denouement</i> of the
conspiracy took place immediately after, in John’s Coffee-house, over
a bottle of wine, with which Mr. Crosbie treated Lord Gardenstone
from the profits of his pleading; and the surprise and mortification of
the barrister, when, on putting his hand into his pocket in order to pay
the reckoning, he discovered the real extent of his fee, can only be
imagined.</p>

<p>Within the last forty years, a curious custom prevailed among the
gentlemen of the long robe in Edinburgh—a custom which, however
little it might be thought of then, would certainly make nine modern
advocates out of ten shudder at every curl just to think of it. This
was the practice of doing all their business, except what required to be
done in the court, in taverns and coffee-houses. Plunged in these
subterranean haunts, the great lawyers of the day were to be found,
surrounded with their myrmidons, throughout the whole afternoon and
evening of the day. It was next to impossible to find a lawyer at his
own abode, and, indeed, such a thing was never thought of. The
whole matter was to find out his tavern, which the cadies upon the
street—those men of universal knowledge—could always tell, and then
seek the oracle in his own proper <i>hell</i>, as Æneas sought the sibyl. At
that time a Directory was seldom applied to; and even though a
stranger could have consulted the celebrated Peter Williamson’s (supposing
it then to have been published), he might, perhaps, by dint of
research, have found out where Lucky Robertson lived, who, in the
simple words of that intelligencer, “<i>sold the best twopenny</i>;” or he
might have been accommodated, more to his satisfaction, with the
information of who, through all the city, “<i>sett lodgings</i>” and “<i>kept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">{37}</span>
rooms for single men</i>;” but he would have found the Directory of
little use to him in pointing out where he might meet a legal friend.
The cadies, who, at that time, wont to be completely <i>au fait</i> with every
hole and bore in the town, were the only directories to whom a client
from the country, such as Colonel Mannering or Dandie Dinmont,
could in such a case apply.</p>

<p>The peculiar haunt of Mr. Crosbie was Douglas’s tavern in the
Anchor Close, then a respectable and flourishing house, now deserted
and shut up. Here many revelries, similar to those described in the
novel, took place; and here the game of High Jinks was played by a
party of convivial lawyers every Saturday night. The situation of the
house resembles that of Clerihugh, described in “Guy Mannering,”
being the second floor down a steep <i>close</i>, upon the north side of the
High Street. Here a club, called the <i>Crochallan Corps</i>, of which
Robert Burns was a member when in Edinburgh, assembled periodically,
and held bacchanalian orgies, famous for their fierceness and
duration.</p>

<p>There was also a tavern in Writer’s Court, kept by a real person,
named Clerihugh, the peculiarities of which do not resemble those
ascribed to the tavern of the novel, nearly so much as do those of
Douglas’s. Clerihugh’s was, however, a respectable house. There the
magistrates of the city always gave their civic dinners, and, what may
perhaps endear it more in our recollections, it was once the favourite
resort of a Boswell, a Gardenstone, and a Home. We may suppose
that such a house as Douglas’s gave the idea of the tavern described by
our author, while <i>Clerihugh</i> being a more striking name, and better
adapted for his purpose, he adopted it in preference to the real one.</p>

<p>The custom of doing all business in taverns gave that generation of
lawyers a very dissipated habit, and to it we are to attribute the ruin
of Mr. Crosbie. That gentleman being held in universal esteem and
admiration, his company was much sought after; and, while his
celibacy gave every opportunity that could be desired, his own disposition
to social enjoyments tended to confirm the evil. An anecdote
is told of him, which displays in a striking manner the extent to which
he was wont to go in his debaucheries. He had been engaged to
plead a cause, and had partially studied the <i>pros</i> and <i>cons</i> of the case,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">{38}</span>
after which he set off and plunged headlong into those convivialities
with which he usually closed the evening. His debauch was a fierce
one, and he did not get home till within an hour of the time when the
court was to open. It was then too late for sleep, and all other efforts
to cool the effervescence of his spirits, by applying wet cloths to his
temples, etc., were vain; so that when the case was called, reason had
scarcely reassumed her deserted throne. Nevertheless, he opened up
with his usually brilliancy, and soon got warm into the argument; but
not far did he get leave to proceed with his speech, when the agent
came up behind, with horror and alarm in his face, pulled him by the
gown, and whispered into his ear, “What the deevil! Mr. Crosbie!
ye’ll ruin a’! ye’re on the wrang side; the very Lords are winking at it;
and the client is gi’en’ a’ up for lost.” The crapulous barrister gave a
single glance at the <i>exordia</i> of his papers, and instantly comprehended
his mistake. However, not at all abashed, he rose again, and “Such
my lords,” says he, “are probably the weak and intemperate arguments
of the defender, concerning which, as I have endeavoured to state
them, you can only entertain one opinion, namely, that they are utterly
false, groundless, and absurd.” He then turned to upon the right side
of the question, pulled to pieces all that he had said before, and represented
the case in an entirely different light; and so much and so
earnestly did he exert himself in order to repair his error, that he
actually gained the cause.</p>

<p>Some allusion is made to Mr. Crosbie’s propensity to wine, in a
birthday ode, written in his honour by his friend, Mr. Maclaurin (afterwards
Lord Dreghorn), and set to music by the celebrated Earl of
Kelly. We there learn that, at his birth, Venus, Bacchus, and Astrea,
came and contended for the possession of his future affections, and that
Jove gave a decision to this effect:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis ordered, boy, Love, Law, and Wine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall thy strange cup of life compose;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But, though the three are all divine,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The last shall be thy <i>favourite dose</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was indeed his favourite dose, and proved at last a fatal one. But,
before we relate the history of his end, it will be necessary to notice a
few particulars respecting his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">{39}</span></p>

<p>Towards the conclusion of the American war, when Edinburgh raised
a defensive band, and offered its services to government, Mr. Crosbie
interested himself very much in the patriotic scheme, and was appointed
lieutenant-colonel of the regiment. About the same period, he also
interested himself very deeply in a business of a different description,
namely, the institution of the Scottish Antiquarian Society, which was
first projected by the Earl of Buchan. Mr. Crosbie was one of the
original members, and had the honour to be appointed a censor.
Honourable mention is made of him in his friend Boswell’s Tour to the
Hebrides, being one of the northern literati who were introduced to
Dr. Johnson when he passed through Edinburgh. In the life of Johnson,
also, it will be found that the barrister visited the great lexicographer
in London, shortly after the Doctor had returned from his
northern excursion. The conversations which took place on both these
occasions are curious, but not sufficiently interesting to be extracted
into this work.</p>

<p>In the course of a long successful practice, the original of Pleydell
acquired some wealth; and, at the time when the New Town of
Edinburgh began to be built, with an enthusiasm prevalent at the
period, he conceived the best way of laying out his money to be in the
erection of houses in that noble and prosperous extension of the city.
He therefore spent all he had, and ran himself into considerable debt,
in raising a structure which was to surpass all the edifices yet erected,
for making the design of which he employed that celebrated architect,
Mr. James Craig, the nephew of Mr. Thomson, who planned the New
Town on its projection in 1767. The house which Mr. Crosbie erected
was to the north of the splendid mansion built by Sir Lawrence
Dundas, which subsequent times have seen converted into an excise-office;
and as the beauty of Mr. C.’s house was in a great measure
subservient to the decoration of Sir Lawrence’s, that gentleman, with
his accustomed liberality, made his tasteful neighbour a present of five
hundred pounds. Yet this <i>bonus</i> proved, after all, but an insufficient
compensation for the expense which Mr. Crosbie had incurred in his
sumptuous speculation; and the unfortunate barrister, who, by his
taste, had attracted the wonder and envy of all ranks, was thought to
have made himself a considerable loser in the end. While it was yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">{40}</span>
unfinished, he removed from Allan’s Close, and, establishing himself in
one of its corners, realized Knickerbocker’s fable of the snail in the
lobster’s shell. He lived in it for some time, in a style of extravagance
appropriate to the splendour of his mansion; till, becoming embarrassed
by his numerous debts, and beginning to feel the effects of other
imprudencies, he was at last obliged to resort to Allan’s Close, and
take up with his old abode and his diminished fortunes. About this
period his constitution appeared much injured by his habits of life, and
he was of course unable to attend to business with his former alacrity.
An incipient passion for dogs, horses, and cocks, was another strong
symptom of decay. To crown all, he made a low marriage with a
woman who had formerly been his menial, and (some said) his
mistress; and as this tended very much to take away the esteem of
the world, his practice began to forsake, and his friends to neglect
him.</p>

<p>It was particularly unfortunate that, about this time, he lost the habit
of frequenting one particular tavern, as he had been accustomed to do
in his earlier and better years. The irregularity consequent upon
visiting four or five of a night, in which he drank liquors of different
sorts and qualities, was sufficient to produce the worst effects. Had he
always steadily adhered to Clerihugh’s or Douglas’s, he might have
been equally fortunate with many of his companions, who had
frequented particular taverns, through several generations of possessors,
seldom missing a night’s attendance, during the course of fifty years,
from ill health or any other cause.</p>

<p>It is a melancholy task to relate the end of Mr. Crosbie. From one
depth he floundered down to another, every step in his conduct tending
towards a climax of ruin. Infatuation and despair led him on, disrespect
and degradation followed him. When he had reached what
might be called the goal of his fate, he found himself deserted by all
whom he had ever loved or cherished, and almost destitute of a single
attendant to administer to him the necessaries of life. Bound by
weakness and disease to an uneasy pallet, in the garret of his former
mansion, he lingered out the last weeks of life in pain, want, and
sickness. So completely was he forsaken by every friend, that not one
was by at the last scene to close his eyes or carry him to the grave.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">{41}</span>
Though almost incredible, it is absolutely true, that he was buried by
a few unconcerned strangers, gathered from the street; and this
happened in the very spot where he had been known all his life, in
the immediate neighbourhood of hundreds who had known, loved, and
admired him for many years. He died on the 25th of February, 1785.</p>


<h3>DRIVER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Crosbie’s</span> clerk was a person named <span class="smcap">Robert H——</span>, whose
character and propensities agreed singularly well with those of Mr.
Pleydell’s dependant, Driver. He was himself a practitioner before the
courts, of the meaner description, and is remembered by many who
were acquainted with the public characters of Edinburgh, towards the
end of last century. He was frequently to be seen in the forenoon,
scouring the closes of the High Street, or parading the Parliament
Square; sometimes seizing his legal friends by the button, and
dragging them about in the capacity of listeners, with an air and
manner of as great importance as if he had been up to the very pen in
his ear in business.</p>

<p>He was a pimpled, ill-shaven, smart-speaking, clever-looking fellow,
usually dressed in grey under-garments, an old hat nearly brushed to
death, and a black coat, of a fashion at least in the seventh year of its
age, scrupulously buttoned up to his chin. It was in his latter and
more unfortunate years that he had become thus slovenly. A legal
gentleman, who gives us information concerning him, recollects when
he was nearly the greatest fop in Edinburgh—being powdered in the
highest style of fashion, wearing two gold watches, and having the
collar of his coat adorned with a beautiful loop of the same metal.
After losing the protection of Mr. Crosbie, he had fallen out of all
regular means of livelihood; and unfortunately acquiring an uncontrollable
propensity for social enjoyments, like the ill-fated Robert
Fergusson, with whom he had been intimately acquainted, he became
quite unsettled—sometimes did not change his apparel for weeks—sat
night and day in particular taverns—and, in short, realized what
Pleydell asserted of Driver, that “sheer ale supported him under
everything; was meat, drink, and cloth—bed, board, and washing.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">{42}</span>
In his earlier years he had been very regular in his irregularities, and
was a “complete fixture” at John Baxter’s tavern, in Craig’s Close,
High Street, where he was the <i>Falstaff</i> of a convivial society, termed
the “<i>Eastcheap Club</i>.” But his dignity of conduct becoming gradually
dissipated and relaxed, and there being also, perhaps, many a landlady
who might have said with Dame Quickly, “I warrant you he’s an
infinite thing upon my score,” he had become unfortunately migrative
and unsteady in his taproom affections. One night he would get
drunk at the sign of the <i>Sautwife</i>, in the Abbeyhill, and next morning
be found tipping off a corrective dram at a porter-house in Rose Street.
Sometimes, after having made a midnight tumble into “the Finish”
in the Covenant Close, he would, by next afternoon, have found his
way (the Lord and the policeman only knew how) to a pie-office in the
Castlehill. It was absolutely true that he could write his papers as
well drunk as sober, asleep as awake; and the anecdote which the
facetious Pleydell narrated to Colonel Mannering, in confirmation of
this miraculous faculty, is also, we are able to inform the reader, strictly
consistent in truth with an incident of real occurrence.</p>

<p>Poor H—— was one of those happy, thoughtless, and imprudent
mortals, whose idea of existence lies all in to-day, or to-morrow at
farthest,—whose whole life is only a series of random exertions and
chance efforts at subsistence—a sort of constant <i>Maroon war</i> with
starvation. His life had been altogether passed in Edinburgh. All he
knew, besides his professional lore, was of <i>Edinburgh</i>; but then he
knew <i>all</i> of that. There did not exist a tavern in the capital of which
he could not have winked you the characters of both the waiters and
the beefsteaks at a moment’s notice. He was at once the annalist of
the history, the mobs, the manners, and the jokes of Edinburgh—a
human phial, containing its whole essential spirit, corked with wit and
labelled with pimples.</p>

<p>H—— was a man rich in all sorts of humour and fine sayings. His
conversation was dangerously delightful. Had he not unhappily
fallen into debauched habits, he possessed abilities that might have
entitled him to the most enviable situations about the Court; but, from
the nature of his peculiar habits, his wit was the only faculty he ever
displayed in its full extent—pity it was the only one that could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">{43}</span>
exerted for his own benefit! To have seen him set down “for a night
of it” in Lucky F——’s, with a few cronies as <i>drowthie</i> as himself,
and his <i>Shadow</i> (a person who shall hereafter be brought to light), was
in itself a most exquisite treat. By the time that the injunction of
“another half-mutchkin, mistress,” had been six times repeated, his
lips, his eyes, and his nose, spoke, looked, and burned wit—pure wit!
“He could not ope his mouth, but out there flew a trope.” The very
sound of his voice was in itself a waggery; the twinkle of his eye
might have toppled a whole theatre over into convulsions. He could
not even spit but he was suspected of a witticism, and received the
congratulation of a roar accordingly. Nay, at the height of such a tide
as this, he would sometimes get the credit of Butler himself for an
accidental scratch of his head.</p>

<p>His practice as a writer (for so he is styled in Peter Williamson’s
Directory) lay chiefly among the very dregs of desperation and
poverty, and was withal of such a nature as to afford him the humblest
means of subsistence. Being naturally damned, as he himself used to
say, with the utmost goodness of heart, he never hesitated at taking
any poverty-struck case by the hand that could hold forth the slightest
hope of success, and was perfectly incapable of resisting any appeal to
his sense of justice, if made in <i>forma pauperis</i>. The greater part of
his clients were poor debtors in the Heart of Midlothian, and he was
most frequently employed in cases of <i>cessio</i>, for the accomplishment of
which he was, from long practice, peculiarly qualified. He had
himself a sort of instinctive hatred of the name of creditor, and would
have been at any time perfectly willing to fight <i>gratis</i> upon the debtor’s
side out of pure amateurship. His idle and debauched habits, also,
laid him constantly open to the company of the lowest litigants, who
purchased his advice or his opinion, and, in some cases, even his services
as an agent, for the paltriest considerations in the shape of liquor; and,
unfortunately, he did not possess sufficient resolution to withstand
such temptations—his propensity for social enjoyments, which latterly
became quite ungovernable, disposing him to make the greatest
sacrifices for its gratification.</p>

<p>Yet this man, wretched as he eventually was, possessed a perfect
knowledge of the law of Scotland, besides a great degree of professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">{44}</span>
cleverness; and, what with his experience under Mr. Crosbie,
and his having been so long a hanger-on of the Court, was considered
one of the best agents that could be employed in almost any class of
cases. It is thought by many of his survivors that, if his talents had
been backed by steadiness of application, he might have attained to
very considerable eminence. At least, it has been observed, that many
of his contemporaries, who had not half of his abilities, by means of
better conduct and greater perseverence, have risen to enviable distinction.
Mr. Crosbie always put great reliance in him, and sometimes
intrusted him with important business; and H—— has even been seen
to destroy a paper of Mr. Crosbie’s writing, and draw up a better
himself, without incurring the displeasure which such an act of
disrespect seemed to deserve. The highest compliment, however, that
could be paid to Mr. H——’s abilities, was the saying of an old man,
named Nicol,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> a native of that litigious kingdom, Fife, who, for a
long course of years, pestered the Court, <i>in forma pauperis</i>, with a
process about a dunghill, and who at length died in Cupar jail—where
he had been disposed, for some small debt, by a friend, just, as was
asserted, to keep him out of harm’s way. Old John used to treat
H—— in Johnnie Dowie’s, and get, as he said, <i>the law out o’ him</i> for
the matter of a dram. He declared that “he would not give H——’s
drunken glour at a paper for the serious opinions of the haill bench!”</p>

<p>Sunday was wont to be a very precious day to H——,—far too
good to be lost in idle dram-drinking at home. On Saturday nights
he generally made a point of insuring stock to the amount of half-a-crown
in his landlady’s hands, and proposed a tour of jollity for next
morning to a few of his companions. These were, for the most part,
poor devils like himself, who, with few lucid intervals of sobriety or
affluence—equally destitute of industry, prudence, and care for the
opinion of the world—contrive to fight, drink, and roar their way
through a desperate existence, in spite of the devil, their washerwoman,
and the small-debt-court—perhaps even receiving Christian burial at
last like the rest of their species. With one or two such companions
as these, H—— would issue of a Sunday morning through the Watergate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">{45}</span>
on an expedition to Newhaven, Duddingstone, Portobello, or
some such guzzling retreat,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>—the termination of their walk being
generally determined by the consideration of where they might have
the best drink, the longest credit, or where they had already least
debt. Then was it most delightful to observe by what a special act
of Providence they would alight upon “the last rizzer’d haddock in
the house,” or “the only hundred oysters that was to be got in the
town;” and how gloriously they would bouse away their money, their
credit, and their senses, till, finally, after uttering, for the thousand
and first time, all their standard Parliament-House jokes—after
quarrelling with the landlord, and flattering the more susceptible landlady
up to the sticking-place of “a last gill,”—they would reel away
home, in full enjoyment of that glory which, according to Robert
Burns, is superior to the glory of even kings!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, H—— was not utterly given up to Sunday debauches,
nor was he destitute of a sense of religion. He made a point of always
going to church on rainy Sundays—that is to say, when his neckcloth
happened to be in its honey-moon, and the button-moulds of his
vestments did not chance to be beyond their first phase. He was not,
therefore, very consistent in his devotional sentiments and observances;
for the weather shared with his tailor the credit of determining him in
all such matters. He was like Berwick smacks of old, which only
sailed, “wind and weather permitting.” When, however, the day
was favourably bad, he would proceed to the High Church of St. Giles
(where, excepting on days of <i>General Assembly</i>, there are usually
enow of empty seats for an army), and, on observing that the Lords
of Session had not chosen to hold any <i>sederunt</i> that day, he would pop
into their pew. In this conspicuous seat, which he perhaps considered
a sort of common property of the College of Justice, he would
look wonderfully at his ease, with one threadbare arm lolling
carelessly over the velvet-cushioned gallery, while in the other hand he
held his mother’s old black pocket Bible—a relic which he had contrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">{46}</span>
to preserve for an incredible number of years, through a
thousand miraculous escapades from lodgings where he was insolvent,
in memory of a venerable relation, whom he had never forgot, though
oblivious of every other earthly regard besides.</p>

<p>Mr. H——’s <i>Shadow</i>, whom we mentioned a few pages back,
however unsubstantial he may seem from his <i>sobriquet</i>, was a real
person, and more properly entitled Mr. <span class="smcap">Nimmo</span>. He had long been
a dependant of H——’s, whence he derived this strange designation.
Little more than the shadow of a recollection of him remains as
<i>materiel</i> for description. He bore somewhat of the same relation to
his principal which Silence bears to Shallow, in Henry IV.,—that is,
he was an exaggerated specimen of the same species, and exhibited
the peculiarities of H——’s habits and character in a more advanced
stage. He was a prospective indication of what H—— was to
become. H——, like Mr. Thomas Campbell’s “coming events,” cast
his “shadow before;” and Nimmo was this shadow. When H——
got new clothes, Nimmo got the <i>exuviæ</i> or cast-off garments, which
he wore on and on, as long as his principal continued without a new
supply. Therefore, when H—— became shabby, Nimmo was
threadbare; when H—— became threadbare, Nimmo was almost
denuded; and when H—— became almost denuded, Nimmo was
quite naked! Thus, also, when H——, after a successful course of
practice, got florid and in good case, Nimmo followed and exhibited
a little colour upon the wonted pale of his cheeks; when H——
began to fade, Nimmo withered before him; by the time H—— was
<i>looking thin</i>, Nimmo was <i>thin indeed</i>; and when H—— was
attenuated and sickly, poor Nimmo was as slender and airy as a
moonbeam. Nimmo was in all things beyond, before, ahead of
H——. If H—— was elevated, Nimmo was tipsy; if H—— was
tipsy, Nimmo was <i>fou</i>; if H—— was <i>fou</i>, Nimmo was dead-drunk;
and if H—— persevered and got dead-drunk also, Nimmo was sure
still to be beyond him, and was perhaps packed up and laid to sleep
underneath his principal’s chair. Nimmo, as it were, cleared the way
for H——’s progress towards destruction—was his pioneer, his vidette,
his harbinger, his avant-courier—the aurora of his rising, the twilight
of his decline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">{47}</span></p>

<p>Nimmo naturally, and to speak of him without relation to the person
of whom he was part and parcel, was altogether so inarticulate, so
empty, so meagre, so inane a being, that he could scarcely be
reckoned more than a mere thread of the vesture of humanity—a
whisper of Nature’s voice. Nobody knew where he lived at night: he
seemed then to disappear from the face of the earth, just as other
shadows disappear on the abstraction of the light which casts them.
He was quite a casual being—appeared by chance, spoke by chance,
seemed even to exist only by chance, as a mere occasional exhalation
of chaos, and at last evaporated from the world to sleep with the
shadows of death,—all by chance. To have seen him, one would have
thought it by no means impossible for him to dissolve himself and go
into a phial, like Asmodeus in the laboratory at Madrid. His figure
was in fact a libel on the human form divine. It was perfectly
unimaginable what he would have been like <i>in puris naturalibus</i>, had
the wind suddenly blown him out of his clothes some day—an accident
of which he seemed in constant danger. It is related of him, that he
was once mistaken, when found dead-drunk in a gutter, on the
morning after a king’s birth-day, for the defunct corpse of <i>Johnnie
Wilkes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> which had been so loyally kicked about the streets by the
mob on the preceding evening; but, on a scavenger proceeding to
sweep him down the channel, he presently sunk from the exalted
character imputed to him, by rousing himself, and calling lustily,
“Another bottle—just another bottle, and then we’ll go!” upon
which the deceived officer of police left him to the management of the
stream.</p>

<p>Besides serving Mr. H—— in the character of clerk or amanuensis,
he used to dangle at his elbow on all occasions, swear religiously to
all his charges, and show the way in laughing at all his jokes. He
was so clever in the use of his pen in transcription, that his hand
could travel over a sheet at the rate of eleven knots an hour, and
this whether drunk or sober, asleep or awake. Death itself could
scarcely have chilled his energies, and it was one of his favourite jokes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">{48}</span>
in vaunting of the latter miraculous faculty, to declare that he intended
to delay writing his will till after his decease, when he would guide
himself in the disposal of his legacies by the behaviour of his relations.
We do not question his abilities for such a task; but one might have
had a pretty good guess, from Nimmo’s appearance, that he would
scarcely ever find occasion, either before or after death, to exercise
them.</p>

<p>These sketches, from the quaint flippancy of their style, may be suspected
of fancifulness and exaggeration; yet certain it is, that out of
the ten thousand persons said to be employed in this legal metropolis in
the solicitation, distribution, and execution of justice, many individuals
may even yet be found, in whom it would be possible to trace the
lineaments we have described. Such persons as H—— and Nimmo
dangle at the elbows of The Law, and can no more be said to belong
to its proper body than so many rats in a castle appertain to the
garrison.</p>

<p>H—— continued in the course of life which we have attempted to
describe till the year 1808, when his constitution became so shattered,
that he was in a great measure unfitted for business or for intercourse
with society. Towards the end of his life, his habits had become still
more irregular than before, and he seemed to hasten faster and faster as
he went on to destruction, like the meteor, whose motion across the sky
seems to increase in rapidity the moment before extinction. After the
incontestable character of the greatest wit and the utmost cleverness
had been awarded to him,—after he had spent so much money and
constitution in endeavouring to render his companions happy, that
some of them, more grateful or more drunken than the rest, actually
confessed him to be “a devilish good-natured foolish sort of fellow,”—after
he had, like certain Scottish poets, almost drunk himself into
the character of a genius,—it came to pass that—he died. A mere
pot-house reveller like him is no more missed in the world of life than
a sparrow or a bishop. There was no one to sorrow for his loss—no
one to regret his absence—save those whose friendship is worse than
indifference. It never was very distinctly known how or where he
died. It was alone recorded of him, as of the antediluvian patriarchs,
that <i>he died</i>. As his life had become of no importance, so his death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">{49}</span>
produced little remark and less sorrow. On the announcement of the
event to a party of his old drinking friends, who, of course, were all
decently surprised, etc., one of them in the midst of the <i>Is it
possibles? Not-possibles!</i> and <i>Can it be possibles?</i> incidental to the
occasion, summed up his elegy, by trivially exclaiming, “Lord! is Rab
dead at last! Weel, that’s strange indeed!—not a week since I drank
six half-mutchkins wi’ him down at <i>Amos’s</i>! Ah! he was a good
bitch! (Then raising his voice) Bring us in a biscuit wi’ the next gill,
mistress! Rab was ay fond o’ bakes!” And they ate a biscuit to his
memory!</p>

<p>It is somewhat remarkable that the deaths of Crosbie and H——
should have been produced by causes and attended by circumstances
nearly the same, though a period of full twenty years had intervened
between the events. Both were men of great learning and abilities,—they
were drawn down from the height in which their talents entitled
them to shine by the same unfortunate propensities,—and while, in
their latter days, both experienced the reverse of fortune invariably
attendant upon imprudence, they at length left the scene of their
notoriety, equally despised, deserted, and miserable.</p>

<p>Both cases are well calculated to illustrate the lesson so strenuously
inculcated by Johnson,—that to have friends we must first be virtuous,
as there is no friendship among the profligate.</p>

<p>Mr. Crosbie’s death presents the more trite moral of the two—for in
it we see little more than the world forsaking an unfortunate man, as
crowds fly from the falling temple, to avoid being crushed in the ruins.
But the moral of Mr. H——’s death is striking and valuable. In him
we see a man of the brightest genius gradually losing that self-respect,
so necessary, even when it amounts to pride, for the cultivation and
proper enjoyment of superior mental powers,—becoming in time unsettled
in his habits, and careless of public estimation,—losing the
attachment of friends of his own rank, and compensating the loss by
mixing with associates of the lowest order:—next, become incapable of
business, we see him dejected and forlorn as poverty itself, by turns
assuming every colour and every aspect of which the human countenance
and figure is susceptible, till the whole was worn down to a degree
of indiscriminate ruin—the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of change:—at length, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">{50}</span>
every vulgar mode of enjoyment had been exhausted, and when even
the fiercest stimulants had grown insipid, we see him lost at once to
sensibility and to sensation, encountering the last evils of mortality in
wretchedness and obscurity, unpitied by the very persons for whom he
had sacrificed so much, and leaving a name for which he expected to
acquire the fame of either talent or misfortune,</p>

<h3>SOUTH COUNTRY FARMERS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Dandie Dinmont.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the Author of “Waverley” has nowhere so completely given
the effect of reality to his portraiture as in the case of honest Dandie
Dinmont, the renowned yeoman of Charlieshope. This personage
seems to be quite familiar to his mind, present to his eye, domesticated
in the chambers of his fancy. The minutest motions of the farmer’s
body, and the most trivial workings of his mind, are alike bright in
his eye; and so faithful a representation has been produced, that one
might almost think the author had taken his sketch by some species of
mental <i>camera obscura</i>, which brought the figure beneath his pencil in
all its native colours and proportions.</p>

<p>It is impossible to point out any individual of real life as the original
of this happy production. It appears to be entirely generic—that is to
say, the whole class of Liddisdale farmers is here represented, and
little more than a single thread is taken from any single person to form
the web of the character. Three various persons have been popularly
mentioned as furnishing the author with his most distinguished traits,
each of whom have their followers and believers among the country
people. It will perhaps be possible to prove that Dandie Dinmont is
a sort of compound of all three, the ingredients being leavened and
wrought up with the general characteristic qualities of the “Lads of
Liddisdale.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">{51}</span></p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Archibald Park</span>, late of Lewinshope, near Selkirk, brother
of the celebrated Mungo Park, was the person always most strongly
insisted on as being the original of Dandie. He was a man of prodigious
strength, in stature upwards of six feet, and every member of
his body was in perfect accordance with his great height. He completely
realized the most extravagant ideas that the poets of his country
formerly entertained of the stalwart borderers; and his achievements
“by flood and field,” in the violent exercises and sports of his profession,
came fully up to those of the most distinguished heroes of
border song. He had all the careless humour and boisterous hospitality
of the Liddisdale farmer. On the appearance of the novel, his
neighbours at once put him down as the Dandie Dinmont of real life,
and he was generally addressed by the name of his supposed archetype
by his familiar associates, so long as he remained in that part of the
country, which, however, was not long. His circumstances requiring
him to relinquish his farm, he obtained, by the interest of some friends,
the situation of collector of customs at Tobermory, to which place he
removed in 1815. Soon after he had settled there, he was attacked by
a paralytic affection, from which he never thoroughly recovered, and he
died in 1821, aged about fifty years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John Thorburn</span>, of Juniper Bank, the person whom we
consider to have stood in the next degree of relationship to Dinmont,
was a humorous good-natured farmer, very fond of hunting and
fishing, and a most agreeable companion over a bottle. He was truly
an unsophisticated worthy man. Many amusing anecdotes are told of
him in the south, and numerous scenes have been witnessed in his
hospitable mansion, akin to that described in the novel as taking
place upon the return of Dandie from “Stagshawbank fair.” The
interior economy of Juniper Bank is said to have more nearly resembled
Charlieshope than did that of Lewinshope, the residence of
Mr. Park. Indeed the latter bore no similarity whatever to Charlieshope,
excepting in the hospitality of the master and the Christian name
of the mistress of the house. Mr. Park, like his fictitious counterpart,
was one of the most generous and hearty landlords alive; and his
wife, who was a woman of highly respectable connections, bore, like
Mrs. Dinmont, the familiar abbreviated name of <i>Ailie</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">{52}</span></p>

<p>Thorburn, like Dandie, was once before <i>the feifteen</i>. The celebrated
Mr. Jeffrey being retained in his cause, Thorburn went into Court to
hear his pleading. He was delighted with the talents and oratory of
his advocate; and, on coming out, observed to his friends, “Od, he’s
an <i>awfu’ body</i> yon; he said things that I never could hae thought o’
mysel’.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">James Davidson</span>, of Hindlee, another honest south-country
farmer, was pointed out as the prototype of Dandie Dinmont. This
gentleman used to breed numerous families of terriers, to which he
gave the names of Pepper and Mustard, in all their varieties of <i>Auld</i>
and Young, Big and Little; and it was this community of designation
in the dogs of the two personages, rather than any particular similarity
in the manners or characters of themselves, that gave credit to the
conjecture of Mr. Davidson’s friends.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It will appear, from these notices, that no individual has sat for the
portrait of Dinmont, but that it has been painted from indiscriminate
recollections of various border store-farmers. We cannot do better
than conclude with the words of the author himself, when introducing
this subject to the reader:—“The present store-farmers of the south of
Scotland are a much more refined race than their fathers, and the
manners I am now to describe have either altogether disappeared
or are greatly modified. Without losing their rural simplicity of
manners, they now cultivate arts unknown to the former generation, not
only in the progressive improvement of their possessions, but in all
the comforts of life. Their houses are more commodious, their habits
of life better regulated, so as better to keep pace with those of the
civilized world; and the best of luxuries, the luxury of knowledge,
has gained much ground among the hills during the last thirty years.
Deep drinking, formerly their greatest failing, is now fast losing
ground; and while the frankness of their extensive hospitality continues
the same, it is, generally speaking, refined in its character, and
restrained in its excesses.”</p>

<h3>A SCOTCH PROBATIONER.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Dominie Sampson.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are few of our <i>originals</i> in whom we can exhibit such precise
points of coincident resemblance between the real and fictitious
character, as in him whom we now assign as the prototype of Dominie
Sampson. The person of <i>real</i> existence also possesses the singular
recommendation of presenting more dignified and admirable characteristics,
in their plain unvarnished detail, than the ridiculous caricature
produced in “Guy Mannering,” though <i>it</i> be drawn by an author
whose elegant imagination has often exalted, but seldom debased, the
materials to which he has condescended to be indebted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">James Sanson</span> was the son of James Sanson, tacksman of
Birkhillside Mill, situate in the parish of Legerwood, in Berwickshire.
After getting the rudiments of his education at a country-school, he
went to the University of Edinburgh, and, at a subsequent period,
completed his probationary studies at that of Glasgow. At these
colleges he made great proficiency in the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew
languages, and became deeply immersed in the depths of philosophy
and theology, of which, as with Dominie Sampson, the more abstruse
and neglected branches were his favourite subjects of application. He
was a close, incessant student; and, in the families where he afterwards
resided as a tutor, all his leisure moments were devoted to the
pursuits of literature. Even his hours of relaxation and walking were
not exempted, in the exceeding earnestness of his solicitude. Then he
was seldom seen without a book, upon which he would be so intent,
that a friend might have passed, and even spoken to him, without
Sanson’s being conscious of the circumstance. After going through
his probationary trials before the presbytery, he became an acceptable,
even an admired preacher, and was frequently employed in assisting
the clergymen of the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>From the narrow circumstances of his father, he was obliged early in
life to become a tutor. Into whose family he first entered is unknown.
However, in this humble situation, owing probably to the parsimonious
economy to which he had been accustomed in his father’s house, he in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">{54}</span>
a short time saved the sum of twenty-five pounds—a little fortune in
those days to a youth of Mr. Sanson’s habits.</p>

<p>With this money he determined upon a pedestrian excursion into
England, for which he was excellently qualified, from his uncommon
strength and undaunted resolution. After journeying over a great part
of the sister kingdom, he came to Harwich, where a sight of the
passage-boats to Holland, and the cheapness of the fare, induced him
to take a trip to the continent. How he was supported during his
peregrinations was never certainly discovered; but he actually travelled
over the greater part of the Netherlands, besides a considerable portion
of Germany, and spent only about the third part of his twenty-five
pounds. He always kept a profound silence upon the subject himself;
but it is conjectured, with great probability, that in the Low Countries
he had recourse to convents, were the monks were ever ready to do acts
of kindness to men of such learning as Sanson would appear to them
to be. Perhaps he procured the means of subsistence by the expedients
which the celebrated Goldsmith is said to have practised in
his continental wanderings, and made the disputation of the morning
supply the dinner of the day.</p>

<p>After his return from the continent, about 1784, he entered the
family of the Rev. Laurence Johnson of Earlston, where he continued
some time, partly employed in the education of his children, and
giving occasional assistance in his public ministerial duty. From this
situation he removed to the house of Mr. Thomas Scott, uncle of the
celebrated Sir Walter, whose family then resided at Ellieston, in the
county of Roxburgh. While superintending this gentleman’s children,
he was appointed to a higher duty—the charge of Carlenridge Chapel,
in the parish of Hawick, which he performed regularly every Sunday,
at the same time that he attended the education of the family through
the week. We may safely conjecture that it was at this particular
period of his life he first was honoured with the title of <i>Dominie
Sanson</i>.</p>

<p>He was next employed by the Earl of Hopetoun, as chaplain to that
nobleman’s tenants at Leadhills, where, with an admirable but unfortunate
tenaciousness of duty, he patiently continued to exercise his
honourable calling, to the irreparable destruction of his own health.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">{55}</span>
The atmosphere being tainted with the natural effluvia of the noxious
mineral which was the staple production of the place, though incapable
of influencing the health of those who had been accustomed to it from
their infancy, had soon a fatal effect upon the life of poor Sanson.
The first calamitous consequence that befel him was the loss of his
teeth; next he became totally blind; and, last of all, to complete the
sacrifice, the insalubrious air extinguished the principle of life. Thus
did this worthy man, though conscious of the fate that awaited him,
choose rather to encounter the last enemy of our nature, than relinquish
what he considered a sacred duty. Strange that one, whose
conduct through life was every way so worthy of the esteem and
gratitude of mankind—whose death would not have disgraced the
devotion of a primitive martyr—should by means of a few less
dignified peculiarities, have eventually conferred the character of perfection
on a work of <i>humour</i>, and, in a caricatured exhibition, supplied
attractions, nearly unparalleled, to innumerable theatres!</p>

<p>Mr. James Sanson was of the greatest stature—near six feet high,
and otherwise proportionately enormous. His person was coarse, his
limbs large, and his manners awkward; so that, while people admired
the simplicity and innocence of his character, they could not help
smiling at the clumsiness of his motions and the rudeness of his
address. His soul was pure and untainted—the seat of many manly
and amiable virtues. He was ever faithful in his duty, both as a
preacher and a tutor, warmly attached to the interests of the family in
which he resided, and gentle in the instruction of his pupils. As a
preacher, though his manner in his public exhibitions, no less than in
private society, was not in his favour, he was well received by every
class of hearers. His discourses were the well-digested productions of
a laborious mind; and his sentiments seldom failed to be expressed
with the utmost beauty and elegance of diction.</p>


<h3>JEAN GORDON.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Meg Merrilies.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> original of this character has been already pointed out and
described in various publications. A desire of presenting, in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">{56}</span>
work, as much original matter as possible, will induce us to be very brief
in our notice of Jean Gordon.</p>

<p>It is impossible to specify the exact date of her nativity, though it
probably was about the year 1670. She was born at Kirk-Yetholm, in
Roxburghshire, the metropolis of the Scottish Gipsies, and was
married to a Gipsy chief, named Patrick Faa, by whom she had ten or
twelve children.</p>

<p>In the year 1714, one of Jean’s sons, named Alexander Faa, was
murdered by another Gipsy, named Robert Johnston, who escaped the
pursuit of justice for nearly ten years, but was then taken and indicted
by his Majesty’s Advocate for the crime. He was sentenced to be
executed, but escaped from prison. It was easier, however, to escape
the grasp of justice than to elude the wide spread talons of Gipsy
vengeance. Jean Gordon traced the murderer like a blood-hound,
followed him to Holland, and from thence to Ireland, where she had
him seized, and brought him back to Jedburgh. Here she obtained
the full reward of her toils, by having the satisfaction of seeing him
hanged on Gallowhill. Some time afterwards, Jean being at Sourhope,
a sheep-farm on Bowmont-water, the goodman said to her, “Weel,
Jean, ye hae got Rob Johnston hanged at last, and out o’ the way?”
“Ay, gudeman,” replied Jean, lifting up her apron by the two corners,
“and a’ that fu’ o’ gowd hasna done’t.” Jean Gordon’s “apron fu’ o’
gowd” may remind some of our readers of Meg Merrilies’ poke of
jewels; and indeed the whole transaction forcibly recalls the stern
picture of that intrepid heroine.</p>

<p>The circumstance in “Guy Mannering,” of Brown being indebted
to Meg Merrilies for lodging and protection, when he lost his way near
Derncleugh, finds a remarkably precise counterpart in an anecdote
related of Jean Gordon:—A farmer with whom she had formerly been
on good terms, though their acquaintance had been interrupted for
several years, lost his way, and was benighted among the mountains
of Cheviot. A light glimmering through the hole of a desolate barn,
that had survived the farmhouse to which it once belonged, guided
him to a place of shelter. He knocked at the door, and it was immediately
opened by Jean Gordon. To meet with such a character
in so solitary a place, and probably at no great distance from her clan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">{57}</span>
was a terrible surprise to the honest man, whose rent, to lose which
would have been ruin to him, was about his person. Jean set up a
shout of joyful recognition, forced the farmer to dismount, and, in the
zeal of her kindness, hauled him into the barn. Great preparations
were making for supper, which the gudeman of Lochside, to increase
his anxiety, observed was calculated for at least a dozen of guests.
Jean soon left him no doubt upon the subject, but inquired what money
he had about him, and made earnest request to be made his purse-keeper
for the night, as the “<i>bairns</i>” would soon be home. The poor
farmer made a virtue of necessity, told his story, and surrendered his
gold to Jean’s custody. She made him put a few shillings in his
pocket, observing, it would excite suspicion, were he found travelling
altogether penniless. This arrangement being made, the farmer lay
down on a sort of shake-down, upon some straw, but, as will easily be
believed, slept not. About midnight the gang returned with various
articles of plunder, and talked over their exploits in language which made
the farmer tremble. They were not long in discovering their guest, and
demanded of Jean whom she had there? “E’en the winsome gudeman
o’ Lochside, poor body,” replied Jean; “he’s been at Newcastle
seeking for siller to pay his rent, honest man, but de’il-be-licket he’s
been able to gather in, and sae he’s gaun e’en hame wi’ a toom purse
and a sair heart.” “That may be, Jean,” said one of the banditti,
“but we maun rip his pouches a bit, and see if it be true or no.”
Jean set up her throat in exclamation against this breach of hospitality,
but without producing any change in their determination. The farmer
soon heard their stifled whispers and light steps by his bed-side, and
understood they were rummaging his clothes. When they found the
money which the providence of Jean Gordon had made him retain, they
held a consultation if they should take it or no; but the smallness of
the booty, and the vehemence of Jean’s remonstrances, determined them
in the negative. They caroused and went to rest. So soon as day
dawned, Jean roused her guest, produced his horse, which she had
accommodated behind the <i>hallan</i>, and guided him for some miles till
he was on the high-road to Lochside. She then restored his whole
property, nor could his earnest entreaties prevail on her to accept
so much as a single guinea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">{58}</span></p>

<p>It is related that all Jean’s sons were condemned to die at Jedburgh
on the same day. It is said the jury were equally divided; but a
friend to justice, who had slept during the discussion, waked suddenly,
and gave his word for condemnation, in the emphatic words, “<span class="smcap">Hang
them a’</span>.” Jean was present, and only said, “The Lord help the
innocent in a day like this!”</p>

<p>Her own death was accompanied with circumstances of brutal
outrage, of which Jean was in many respects wholly undeserving. Jean
had, among other merits or demerits, that of being a staunch Jacobite.
She chanced to be at Carlisle upon a fair or market-day, soon after
the year 1746, where she gave vent to her political partiality, to the
great offence of the rabble of that city. Being zealous of their loyalty,
when there was no danger, in proportion to the tameness with which
they surrendered to the Highlanders in 1745, they inflicted upon poor
Jean Gordon no slighter penalty than that of ducking her to death in
the Eden. It was an operation of some time; for Jean Gordon was a
stout woman, and, struggling hard with her murderers, often got her
head above water, and while she had voice left, continued to exclaim,
at such intervals, “<i>Charlie yet! Charlie yet!</i>”</p>

<p>Her propensities were exactly the same as those of the fictitious
character of Meg Merrilies. She possessed the same virtue of fidelity,
spoke the same language, and in appearance there was little
difference; yet Madge Gordon, her grand-daughter, was said to have
had the same resemblance. She was descended from the Faas by the
mother’s side, and was married to a Young. She had a large aquiline
nose; penetrating eyes, even in her old age; bushy hair, that hung
around her shoulders from beneath a gipsy bonnet of straw; a short
cloak, of a peculiar fashion; and a long staff, nearly as tall as herself.
When she spoke vehemently (for she had many complaints), she used to
strike her staff upon the floor, and throw herself into an attitude which
it was impossible to regard with indifference.</p>

<p>From these traits of the manners of Jean and Madge Gordon, it
may be perceived that it would be difficult to determine which of the
two Meg Merrilies was intended for; it may therefore, without injustice,
be divided between both. So that if Jean was the prototype
of her <i>character</i>, it is very probable that Madge must have sat to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">{59}</span>
anonymous author of “Guy Mannering” as the representative of her
<i>person</i>.</p>

<p>To the author whose duty leads him so low in the scale of nature,
that the manners and the miseries of a vicious and insubordinate race,
prominent in hideous circumstances of unvarnished reality, are all he
is permitted to record, it must ever be gratifying to find traits of such
fine enthusiasm, such devoted fidelity, as the conduct of Jean Gordon
exhibits in the foregoing incidents. <i>They</i> stand out with a delightful
and luminous effect from the gloomy canvas of guilt, atoning for its
errors and brightening its darkness. To trace further, as others have
done, the disgusting peculiarities of a people so abandoned to all sense
of moral propriety, would only serve to destroy the effect already
created by the redeeming characters of Jean Gordon and her nobler
sister, and more extensively to disgrace the general respectability of
human nature.</p>

<h3>ANDREW GEMMELS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Edie Ochiltree.</i>)</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe4_75" id="i_p_060">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_060.jpg" alt="A" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">ndrew Gemmels</span> or <span class="smcap">Gemble</span>, a wandering <i>blue-gown</i> of the
south of Scotland, is supposed to have been the <i>original</i> of Edie
Ochiltree. The latter, as represented in the novel, bears, it is true, a
much more amiable aspect, and exhibits greater elevation of character,
than the rude old soldier in whom the public has recognised his prototype.
Yet, as we believe there exists a considerable degree of resemblance
between them, a sketch of old Andrew, who was a very singular
personage, will not prove unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>Andrew Gemmels was well known over all the Border districts as a
wandering beggar, or <i>gaberlunzie</i>, for the greater part of half a century.
He had been a soldier in his youth; and the entertaining stories which
he told of his campaigns, and the adventures he had encountered in
foreign countries, united with his shrewdness, drollery, and other agreeable
qualities, rendered him a general favourite, and secured him a
cordial welcome and free quarters at every shepherd’s cot or farm-steading
that lay in the range of his extensive wanderings. He kept a
horse in his latter days; and, so doing, set the proverb at naught. On
arriving at a place of call, he usually put up his horse in some stable
or outhouse, without the ceremony of asking his host’s permission, and
then came into the house, where he stamped and swore till room was
made for him at the fireside. Andrew was not like those degenerate
modern beggars, who implore a coin as for God’s sake, and shelter
themselves in the first hole they can find open to receive them,—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">{61}</span>
ordered and commanded, like the master himself, and only accepted of
his alms by way of obliging his friends. He presumed even to choose
his own bed, and was not pleased unless the utmost attention was
shown to his comfort. He preferred sleeping in an outhouse, and, if
possible, in any place where horses and cattle were kept. The reasons
he might be supposed to have for such a preference are obvious. In an
outhouse he was less exposed in undressing to the curious eyes of the
people, who always suspected him of having treasure concealed in his
clothes; and the company of the animals beneath his bed was preferable
to utter solitude, and, moreover, tended to keep the premises
comfortably warm. He used such art in the matters of his toilette
that no person ever saw him undressed, or made any discovery prejudicial
to his character of poverty.</p>

<p>Andrew was a tall, sturdy, old man, with a face in which the fierceness
and austerity of his character strove for mastery with the expression
of a shrewd and keen intellect. He was usually dressed in the
blue gown or surtout described in “The Antiquary” as the habiliment
of Edie Ochiltree, and his features were shaded with a broad slouched
hat, which had been exchanged at an earlier period for a lowland
bonnet. His feet and ankles were shod with strong iron-soled shoes
and <i>gamashins</i>, or <i>stocking-boots</i>. He always carried a stout walking-staff,
which was nearly as tall as himself, that is to say, not much less
than six feet.</p>

<p>“Though free and unceremonious,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Andrew was never burdensome
or indiscreet in his visits, returning only once or twice a year,
and generally after pretty regular intervals. He evidently seemed to
prosper in his calling; for, though hung around with rags of every
shape and hue, he commonly possessed a good horse, and used to
attend the country fairs and race-courses, where he would bet and
dispute with the farmers and gentry with the most independent and
resolute pertinacity. He allowed that begging had been a good trade
in his time, but used to complain sadly that times were daily growing
worse.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> A person remembers seeing Gemmels travelling about on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">{62}</span>
blood-mare, with a foal after her, and a gold watch in his pocket. On
one occasion, at Rutherford in Tiviotdale, he had dropped a clue of
yarn, and Mr. Mather, his host, finding him searching for it, assisted
in the search, and, having got hold of it, persisted, notwithstanding
Andrew’s opposition, in unrolling the yarn till he came to the <i>kernel</i>,
which, much to his surprise and amusement, he found to consist of
about twenty guineas in gold.”</p>

<p>“My grandfather,” continues this writer, “was exceedingly fond of
Andrew’s company; and, though a devout and strict Cameronian, and
occasionally somewhat scandalized at his rough and irreverent style of
language, was nevertheless so much attracted by his conversation, that
he never failed to spend the evenings of his sojourn in listening to his
entertaining narrations and ‘auld-warld stories,’ with the old shepherds,
hinds, and children seated around them, beside the blazing turf ingle in
‘the farmer’s ha’.’ These conversations generally took a polemical
turn, and not unfrequently ended in violent disputes—my ancestor’s hot
and impatient temper blazing forth in collision with the dry and
sarcastic humour of his ragged guest. Andrew was never known to
yield his point on these occasions; but he usually had the address,
when matters grew too serious, to give the conversation a more pleasant
turn, by some droll remark or unexpected stroke of humour, which
convulsed the rustic group, and the grave gudeman himself, with unfailing
and irresistible merriment.”</p>

<p>“Many curious anecdotes of Andrew’s sarcastic wit and eccentric
manners are current in the Borders. I shall for the present content
myself with one specimen, illustrative of Andrew’s resemblance to his
celebrated representative. The following is given as commonly related
with much good humour by the late Mr. Dodds of the War Office, the
person to whom it chiefly refers:—Andrew happened to be present at a
fair or market somewhere in Tiviotdale (St. Boswell’s, if I mistake not),
where Dodds, at that time a non-commissioned officer in his Majesty’s
service, happened also to be with a military party recruiting. It was
some time during the American War, when they were eagerly beating
up for fresh men—to teach passive obedience to the obdurate and ill-mannered
Columbians; and it was then the practice for recruiting
sergeants after parading for a due space, with all the warlike<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">{63}</span>
pageantry of drums, trumpets, ‘glancing blades, and gay cockades,’ to
declaim in heroic strains of the delights of a soldier’s life—of glory,
patriotism, plunder—the prospect of promotion for the bold and the
young, and his Majesty’s munificent pension for the old and the
wounded, etc., etc. Dodds, who was a man of much natural talent,
and whose abilities afterwards raised him to an honourable rank and
independent fortune, had made one of his most brilliant speeches on
this occasion. A crowd of ardent and active rustics were standing
round, gaping with admiration at the imposing mien, and kindling at
the heroic eloquence of the manly soldier, whom many of them had
known a few years before as a rude tailor boy; the sergeant himself,
already leading in idea a score of new recruits, had just concluded, in
a strain of more than usual elevation, his oration in praise of the
military profession, when Gemmels, who, in tattered guise, was standing
close behind him, reared aloft his <i>meal-pocks</i> on the end of
his <i>kent</i> or pike-staff, and exclaimed, with a tone and aspect of the
most profound derision, ‘<i>Behold the end o’t!</i>’ The contrast was irresistible—the
<i>beau idéal</i> of Sergeant Dodds, and the ragged reality of
Andrew Gemmels, were sufficiently striking; and the former, with his
red-coat followers, beat a retreat in some confusion, amidst the loud
and universal laughter of the surrounding multitude.”</p>

<p>Andrew Gemmels was remarkable for being perhaps the best player
at draughts in Scotland; and in that amusement, which, we may here
observe, is remarkably well adapted for bringing out and employing the
cool, calculating, and shrewd genius of the Scottish nation, he frequently
spent the long winter nights. Many persons still exist who were
taught the mysteries of the <i>dambrod</i><a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> by him, and who were accustomed
to hold a serious contention with him every time he passed the night
in their houses. He was the preceptor of the gudewife of Newby in
Peebles-shire, the grandmother of the present narrator, whose hospitable
mansion was one of his chief resorts. In teaching her, as he said,
he had only “cut a stick to break his ain head”; for she soon became
equally expert with himself, and in the regular <i>set-to’s</i> which took place
between them, did not show either the deference to his master-skill, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">{64}</span>
the fear of his resentment, with which he was usually treated by more
timorous competitors. He could never be brought, however, to acknowledge
heartily her rival pretensions, nor would he, upon any
account, come to such a trial as might have decided the palm of merit
either in his favour or hers. Whenever he saw the tide of success running
on her side, he got dreadfully exasperated, and ordinarily, before
the stigma of defeat could be decidedly inflicted upon him, rose up,
seized <i>the brod</i>, and threw <i>the men</i> into the fire,—accompanying the
action with some of his most terrific and blasphemous imprecations.</p>

<p>The late Lord Elibank, while living at Darnhall, once ordered one
of his cast-off suits to be given to Andrew—the which Andrew thankfully
accepted, and then took his departure. Through the course of the
same day, his lordship, in taking a ride a few miles from home, came
up with Andrew, and was not a little surprised to see him dragging
the clothes behind him along the road, “through dub and mire.” On
being asked his reason for such strange conduct, he replied that he
would have “to trail the duds that way for twa days, to mak them <i>fit
for use</i>!”</p>

<p>In one circumstance Andrew coincides with his supposed archetype:
Andrew had been at Fontenoy, and made frequent allusions to that
disastrous field.</p>

<p>Andrew died in 1793, at Roxburgh-Newton, near Kelso, being, according
to his own account, 105 years of age. His wealth was the
means of enriching a nephew in Ayrshire, who is now a considerable
landholder there, and belongs to a respectable class of society.</p>

</div>
<p class="ph3"><b>Rob Roy.</b></p>


<h3>ANECDOTES OF ROBERT MACGREGOR.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Rob Roy.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> derive the following interesting narrative from Colonel Stewart’s
admirable work on the Highlands.</p>

<p>“The father of the present Mr. Stewart of Ardvorlich knew Rob
Roy intimately, and attended his funeral in 1736—the last at which a
piper officiated in the Highlands of Perthshire. The late Mr. Stewart
of Bohallie, Mr. M‘Nab of Inchewan, and several gentlemen of my
acquaintance, also knew Rob Roy and his family. Alexander Stewart,
one of his followers, afterwards enlisted in the Black Watch. He was
wounded at Fontenoy, and discharged with a pension in 1748. Some
time after this period he was engaged by my grandmother, then a
widow, as a <i>grieve</i>, to direct and take charge of the farm-servants. In
this situation he proved a faithful, trustworthy servant, and was by my
father continued in his situation till his death. He told many anecdotes
of Rob Roy and his party, among whom he was distinguished by the
name of the Bailie, a title which he ever after retained. It was before
him that people were sworn when it was necessary to bind them to
secrecy.</p>

<p>“Robert Macgregor Campbell was a younger son of Donald Macgregor
of Glengyle, in Perthshire, by a daughter of Campbell of Glenlyon,
sister of the individual who commanded at the massacre of
Glenco. He was born some time between 1657 and 1660, and married
Helen Campbell, of the family of Glenfalloch. As cattle was at that
period the principal marketable produce of the hills, the younger sons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">{66}</span>
of gentlemen had few other means of procuring an independent subsistence
than by engaging in this sort of traffic. At an early period
Rob Roy was one of the most respectable and successful drovers in his
district. Before the year 1707 he had purchased of the family of Montrose
the lands of Craigrostane, on the banks of Lochlomond, and had
relieved some heavy debts on his nephew’s estate of Glengyle. While
in this prosperous state, he continued respected for his honourable
dealings both in the Lowlands and Highlands. Previous to the Union
no cattle had been permitted to pass the English border. As a boon
or encouragement, however, to conciliate the people to that measure,
a free intercourse was allowed. The Marquis of Montrose, created a
Duke the same year, and one of the most zealous partisans of the
Union, was the first to take advantage of this privilege, and immediately
entered into partnership with Rob Roy, who was to purchase
the cattle and drive them to England for sale—the Duke and he
advancing an equal sum, 10,000 merks each (a large sum in those days,
when the price of the best ox or cow was seldom twenty shillings); all
the transactions beyond this amount to be on credit. The purchases
having been completed, Macgregor then went to England; but so
many people had entered into a similar speculation, that the market
was completely overstocked, and the cattle sold for much less than
prime cost. Macgregor returned home, and went to the Duke to settle
the account of their partnership, and to pay the money advanced, with
the deduction of the loss. The Duke, it is said, would consent to no
deduction, but insisted on principal and interest. ‘In that case, my
Lord,’ said Macgregor, ‘if these be your principles, I shall not make it
my principle to pay the interest, nor my interest the principal; so if
your Grace do not stand your share of the loss, you shall have no
money from me.’ On this they separated. No settlement of accounts
followed—the one insisting on retaining the money, unless the other
would consent to bear his share of the loss. Nothing decisive was done
till the rebellion of 1715, when Rob Roy ‘was out,’—his nephew Glengyle
commanding a numerous body of the Macgregors, but under the
control of his uncle’s superior judgment and experience. On this
occasion the Duke of Montrose’s share of the cattle speculation was
expended. The next year his Grace took legal means to recover his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">{67}</span>
money, and got possession of the lands of Craigrostane on account of
his debt. This rendered Macgregor desperate. Determined that his
Grace should not enjoy his lands with impunity, he collected a band of
about twenty followers, declared open war against him, and gave up
his old course of regular droving—declaring that the estate of Montrose
should in future supply him with cattle, and he would make the Duke
rue the day in which he quarrelled with him. He kept his word, and
for nearly twenty years, that is, till the day of his death, levied regular
contributions on the Duke and his tenants, not by nightly depredations
and robberies, but in broad day, and in a systematic manner—at an
appointed time making a complete sweep of all the cattle of a district,
always passing over those not belonging to the Duke’s estate, as well
as the estates of his friends and adherents; and having previously given
notice where he was to be by a certain day with his cattle, he was met
there by people from all parts of the country, to whom he sold them
publicly. These meetings, or trystes, as they were called, were held in
different parts of the country; sometimes the cattle were driven south,
but oftener to the north-west, where the influence of his friend the
Duke of Argyll protected him.</p>

<p>“When the cattle were in this manner driven away, the tenants paid
no rent, so that the Duke was the ultimate sufferer. But he was made
to suffer in every way. The rents of the lower farms were partly paid
in grain and meal, which was generally lodged in a storehouse or
granary, called a girnel, near the Loch of Monteith. When Macgregor
wanted a supply of meal, he sent notice to a certain number of the
Duke’s tenants to meet him at the girnel on a certain day, with their
horses, to carry home the meal. They met accordingly, when he
ordered the horses to be loaded, and, giving a regular receipt to the
Duke’s storekeeper for the quantity taken, he marched away—always
entertaining the people very handsomely, and careful never to take the
meal till it had been lodged in the Duke’s storehouse in payment of
rent. When the money rents were paid, Macgregor frequently
attended. On one occasion, when Mr. Graham of Killearn (the factor)
had collected the tenants to pay their rents, all Rob Roy’s men happened
to be absent except Alexander Stewart, ‘the Bailie,’ whom I
have already mentioned. With his single attendant he descended to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">{68}</span>
Chapellairoch, where the factor and the tenants were assembled. He
reached the house after it was dark, and, looking in at the window,
saw Killearn, surrounded by a number of the tenants, with a bag full of
money which he had received, and was in the act of disposing in a
press or cupboard, at the same time saying that he would cheerfully
give all in the bag for Rob Roy’s head. This notification was not lost
on the outside auditor, who instantly gave orders, in a loud voice, to
place two men at each window, two at each corner, and four at each
of the two doors—thus appearing to have twenty men. Immediately
the door opened, and he walked in with his attendant close behind,
each armed with a sword in his right hand and a pistol in his left, and
with dirks and pistols slung in their belts.</p>

<p>“The company started up, but he requested them to sit down, as his
business was only with Killearn, whom he ordered to hand down the
bag and put it on the table. When this was done, he desired the
money to be counted, and proper receipts to be drawn out, certifying
that he had received the money from the Duke of Montrose’s agent, as
the Duke’s property, the tenants having paid their rents, so that no
after-demand could be made against them on account of this transaction;
and finding that some of the people had not obtained receipts, he
desired the factor to grant them immediately, ‘to show his Grace,’
said he, ‘that it is from him I take the money, and not from these
honest men who have paid him.’ After the whole was concluded, he
ordered supper, saying, that as he had got the purse, it was proper
he should pay the bill; and after they had drunk heartily together for
several hours, he called his Bailie to produce his dirk, and lay it naked
on the table. Killearn was then sworn that he would not move, nor
direct any one else to move, from that spot for an hour after the
departure of Macgregor, who thus cautioned him—‘If you break your
oath, you know what you are to expect in the next world—and in this,’
pointing to his dirk. He then walked away, and was beyond pursuit
before the hour expired.</p>

<p>“At another collecting of rents by the same gentleman, Macgregor
made his appearance, and carried him away, with his servant, to a small
island in the west end of Loch Cathrine, and having kept him there
for several days, entertaining him in the best manner, as a duke’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">{69}</span>
representative ought to be, he dismissed him, with the usual receipts
and compliments to his Grace. In this manner did this extraordinary
man live, in open violation and defiance of the laws, and died peaceably
in his bed when nearly eighty years of age. His funeral was attended
by all the country round, high and low—the Duke of Montrose and
his immediate friends only excepted.</p>

<p>“How such things could happen, at so late a period, must appear
incredible; and this, too, within thirty miles of the garrisons of Stirling
and Dumbarton, and the populous city of Glasgow, and, indeed, with
a small garrison stationed at Inversnaid, in the heart of the country,
and on the estate which belonged to Macgregor, for the express purpose
of checking his depredations. The truth is, the thing could
not have happened had it not been the peculiarity of the man’s
character; for, with all his lawless spoliations and unremitted acts of
vengeance and robbery against the Montrose family, he had not an
enemy in the country beyond the sphere of their influence. He never
hurt or meddled with the property of a poor man, and, as I have
stated, was always careful that his great enemy should be the principal,
if not the only sufferer. Had it been otherwise, it was quite impossible
that, notwithstanding all his enterprise, address, intrepidity, and vigilance,
he could have long escaped in a populous country, with a
warlike people, well qualified to execute any daring exploit, such as
the seizure of this man, had they been his enemies, and willing to
undertake it. Instead of which, he lived socially among them—that is,
as social as an outlaw, always under a certain degree of alarm, could
do—giving the education of gentlemen to his sons, frequenting the
most populous towns, and, whether in Edinburgh, Perth, or Glasgow,
equally safe, at the same time that he displayed great and masterly
address in avoiding or calling for public notice.</p>

<p>“The instances of his address struck terror into the minds of the
troops, whom he often defeated and out-generalled. One of these
instances occurred in Breadalbane, in the case of an officer and forty
chosen men sent after him. The party crossed through Glenfalloch to
Tyndrum; and Macgregor, who had correct information of all their
movements, was with a party in the immediate neighbourhood. He
put himself in the disguise of a beggar, with a bag of meal on his back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">{70}</span>
(in those days alms were always bestowed in produce), went to the inn
at Tyndrum, where the party was quartered, walked into the kitchen
with great indifference, and sat down among the soldiers. They soon
found the beggar a lively sarcastic fellow, when they began to attempt
some practical jokes upon him.</p>

<p>“He pretended to be very angry, and threatened to inform Rob
Roy, who would quickly show them they were not to give with impunity
such usage to a poor and harmless person. He was immediately
asked if he knew Rob Roy, and if he could tell where he was? On
his answering that he knew him well, and where he was, the sergeant
informed the officer, who immediately sent for him.</p>

<p>“After some conversation, the beggar consented to accompany them
to Creanlarich, a few miles distant, where he said Rob Roy and his
men were, and that he believed their arms were lodged in one house,
while they were sitting in another. He added that Roy was very
friendly, and sometimes joked with him, and put him at the head of
the table; and ‘when it is dark,’ said he, ‘I will go forward—you
will follow in half an hour—and, when near the house, rush on, place
your men at the back of the house, ready to seize on the arms of the
Highlanders, while you shall go round with the sergeant and two men,
walk in, and call out the whole are your prisoners; and don’t be surprised
though you should see me at the head of the company.’ As they
marched on they had to pass a rapid stream at Dabrie, a spot celebrated
on account of the defeat of Robert Bruce by Macdougal of
Lorn, in the year 1306. Here the soldiers asked their merry friend the
beggar to carry them through on his back. This he did, sometimes
taking two at a time, till he took the whole over, demanding a penny
from each for his trouble. When it was dark they pushed on (the
beggar having gone before), the officer following the directions of his
guide, and darting into the house with the sergeant and three soldiers.
They had hardly time to look to the end of the table, where they saw
the beggar standing, when the door was shut behind them, and they
were instantly pinioned, two men standing on each side holding pistols
to their ears, and declaring that they were dead men if they uttered a
word. The beggar then went out, and called in two more men, who
were instantly secured, and in the same manner with the whole party.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">{71}</span>
Having been disarmed, they were placed under a strong guard till
morning, when he gave them a plentiful breakfast and released them on
parole (the Bailie attending with his dirk, over which the officer gave
his parole) to return immediately to their garrison without attempting
anything more at this time. This promise Rob Roy made secure, by
keeping their arms and ammunition as lawful prize of war.</p>

<p>“Some time after, the same officer was again sent after this noted
character, probably to retrieve his former mishap. In this expedition
he was more fortunate, for he took three of the freebooters prisoners in
the higher parts of Breadalbane, near the scene of the former exploit—but
the conclusion was nearly similar. He lost no time in proceeding
in the direction of Perth, for the purpose of putting his prisoners in
gaol; but Rob Roy was equally alert in pursuit. His men marched in
a parallel line with the soldiers, who kept along the bottom of the
valley, on the south side of Loch Tay, while the others kept close up
the side of the hill, anxiously looking for an opportunity to dash down
and rescue their comrades, if they saw any remissness or want of attention
on the part of the soldiers. Nothing of this kind offered, and the
party had passed Tay Bridge, near which they halted and slept. Macgregor
now saw that something must soon be done or never, as they
would speedily gain the low country, and be out of his reach. In the
course of the night he procured a number of goat-skins and cords, with
which he dressed himself and his party in the wildest manner possible,
and, pushing forward, before daylight took post near the roadside, in a
thick wood below Grandtully Castle. When the soldiers came in a
line with the party in ambush, the Highlanders, with one leap, darted
down upon them, uttering such yells and shouts as, along with their
frightful appearance, so confounded the soldiers, that they were overpowered
and disarmed without a man being hurt on either side. Rob
Roy kept the arms and ammunition, released the soldiers, and marched
away in triumph with his men.</p>

<p>“The terror of his name was much increased by exploits like these,
which, perhaps, lost nothing by the telling, as the soldiers would not
probably be inclined to diminish the danger and fatigues of a duty in
which they were so often defeated. But it is unnecessary to repeat the
stories preserved and related of this man and his actions, which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">{72}</span>
always daring and well contrived, often successful, but never directed
against the poor, nor prompted by revenge, except against the Duke of
Montrose, and without any instance of murder or bloodshed committed
by any of his party, except in their own defence. In the war against
Montrose he was supported and abetted by the Duke of Argyll, from
whom he always received shelter when hard pressed; or, to use a hunting
term, when he was in danger of being earthed by the troops.
These two powerful families were still rivals, although Montrose had
left the Tories and joined Argyll and the Whig interest. It is said that
Montrose reproached Argyll in the House of Peers with protecting the
robber Rob Roy; when the latter, with his usual eloquence and
address, parried off the accusation (which he could not deny) by
jocularly answering, that if he protected a robber, the other supported
him.”</p>

<p>We can only add to this animated history of Rob Roy one circumstance;
which, though accredited in the Highlands, has never been
noticed in the popular accounts of our hero. In whatever degree his
conduct was to be attributed to his own wrongs, or those of his clan,
the disposition which prompted and carried him through in his daring
enterprises, could be traced to the family temper of his mother, who
came of the Campbells of Glenlyon—a peculiarly wild, bold, and
wicked race.</p>

<p>The mode of escape adopted by Rob Roy in crossing the Avon-dhu,
so finely described in the third volume of the novel, seems to have
been suggested by the following traditionary anecdote, which is
preserved in the neighbourhood of the spot where the exploit took
place:—A Cameronian, in the district of Galloway, flying from two
dragoons, who pursued him hotly, came to a precipice which overhung
a lake. Seeing no other means of eluding his enemies, he
plunged into the water, and attempted to swim to the other side. In
the meantime the troopers came up, and fired at him; when he, with
an astonishing presence of mind, parted with his plaid, and swam below
the water to a safe part of the shore. His enemies fired repeatedly at
the plaid, till they supposed him slain or sunk, and then retired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">{73}</span></p>


<h3>PARALLEL PASSAGES.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">A resemblance</span> will be discovered between the following passages—one
being part of Bailie Jarvie’s conversation with Owen, in “Rob
Roy,” and the other an extract from a work entitled, “A Tour through
Great Britain, &amp;c., by a Gentleman, 4th ed. 1748”—a curious book, of
which the first edition was written by the celebrated De Foe:—</p>

<p>“We found the liquor exceedingly palatable, and it led to a long
conversation between Owen and our host, on the opening which the
Union had afforded to trade between Glasgow and the British colonies
in America and the West Indies, and on the facilities which Glasgow
possessed of making up <i>sortable</i> cargoes for that market. Mr. Jarvie
answered some objection which Owen made on the difficulty of sorting
a cargo for America, without buying from England, with vehemence
and volubility.</p>

<p>“‘Na, na, sir; we stand on our ain bottom—we pickle in our ain
pock-neuk. We ha’e our Stirling serges, Musselburgh stuffs, Aberdeen
hose, Edinburgh shalloons, and the like, for our woollen and worsted
goods, and we ha’e linens of a’ kinds, better and cheaper than you
ha’e in London itsel’; and we can buy your north o’ England wares,—as
Manchester wares, Sheffield wares, and Newcastle earthenware—as
cheap as you can, at Liverpool; and we are making a fair spell at
cottons and muslins.’”—<i>Rob Roy</i>, vol. ii., p. 267.</p>

<p>“Glasgow is a city of business, and has the face of foreign as well
as domestic trade,—nay, I may say it is the only city in Scotland that
apparently increases in both. The Union has indeed answered its end
to them, more than to any other part of the kingdom, their trade being
new-formed by it; for as the Union opened the door to the Scots into
our American colonies, the Glasgow merchants presently embraced the
opportunity; and though, at its first concerting, the rabble of the city
made a formidable attempt to prevent it, yet afterwards they knew
better, when they found the great increase of their trade by it, for they
now send fifty sail of ships every year to Virginia, New England, and
other English colonies in America.</p>

<p>“The share they have in the herring-fishery is very considerable;
and they cure their herrings so well and so much better than they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">{74}</span>
done in any other part of Great Britain, that a Glasgow herring is
esteemed as good as a Dutch one.</p>

<p>“I have no room to enlarge upon the home-trade of this city, which
is very considerable in many things. I shall, therefore, touch at some
few particulars:—</p>

<p>“1. Here there are two very handsome sugar-baking houses, carried
on by skilful persons, with large stocks, and to very great perfection.
Here is likewise a large distillery for distilling spirits from the molasses
drawn from sugars, by which they enjoyed a vast advantage for a time,
by a reserved article in the Union, freeing them from English duties.</p>

<p>“2. Here is a manufacture of plaiding, a stuff crossed with yellow,
red, and other mixtures, for the plaids or veils worn by the women of
Scotland.</p>

<p>“3. Here is a manufacture of muslins, which they make so good
and fine that great quantities of them are sent into England, and to the
British plantations, where they sell at a good price. They are generally
striped, and are very much used for aprons by the ladies, and
sometimes in head-clothes by the meaner sort of Englishwomen.</p>

<p>“4. Here is also a linen manufacture; but as that is in common with
all parts of Scotland, which improve in it daily, I will not insist upon
it as a peculiar here, though they make a very great quantity of it, and
send it to the plantations as their principal merchandise. Nor are the
Scots without a supply of goods for sorting their cargoes to the English
colonies, without sending to England for them; and it is necessary to
mention it here, because it has been objected by some that the Scots
could not send a sortable cargo to America without buying from England,
which, coming through many hands, and by a long carriage, must
consequently be so dear, that the English merchants can undersell them.</p>

<p>“It is very probable, indeed, that some things cannot be had here
so well as from England, so as to make out such a sortable cargo as
the Virginia merchants in London ship off, whose entries at the custom-house
consist sometimes of two hundred particulars, as tin, turnery,
millinery, upholstery, cutlery, and other <i>Crooked-Lane</i> wares—in short,
somewhat of everything, either for wearing or house furniture, building
houses or ships.</p>

<p>“But though the Scots cannot do all this, we may reckon up what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">{75}</span>
they can furnish, which they have not only in sufficient quantities, but
some in greater perfection than England itself.</p>

<p>“1. They have woollen manufactories of their own,—such as Stirling
serges, Musselburgh stuffs, Aberdeen stockens, Edinburgh shalloons,
blankets, etc.</p>

<p>“2. Their trade with England being open, they have now all the
Manchester, Sheffield, and Birmingham wares, and likewise the cloths,
kerseys, half-thicks, duffels, stockens and coarse manufactures of the
north of England, brought as cheap or cheaper to them by horse-packs
as they are carried to London, it being at a less distance.</p>

<p>“3. They have linens of most kinds, especially diapers and table-linens,
damasks, and many other sorts not known in England, and
cheaper than there, because made at their own doors.</p>

<p>“4. What linens they want from Holland or Hamburgh, they
import from thence as cheap as the English can do; and for muslins,
their own are very acceptable, and cheaper than in England.</p>

<p>“5. Gloves they make cheaper and better than in England, for they
send great quantities thither.</p>

<p>“6. * * * * * *</p>

<p>“I might mention many other particulars, but this is sufficient to
show that the Scots merchants are not at a loss how to make up sortable
cargoes to send to the plantations; and that if we can outdo them in
some things, they are able to outdo us in others.”—<i>Tour</i>, vol. iv.,
p. 124.</p>

<p>Though only the latter part of the preceding description of Glasgow
trade refers to the passage from “Rob Roy,” we have extracted it all
for various reasons. First, because it gives, independent of allusion to
the novel, a very distinct and simple account of trade in Scotland forty
years after the Union, when the reaction consequent upon that event
was beginning to be felt in the country. Secondly, because it details
at full length the sketch of the rise and progress of Glasgow, which
Mr. Francis Osbaldistone gives in the sixth chapter of the second
volume of “Rob Roy,” on his approach to the mercantile capital.
Thirdly, for the sake of presenting the reader with a very fair specimen
of the use which the Author of “Waverley” makes of old books in his
fictitious narratives.</p>

<h3>LANG SHEEP AND SHORT SHEEP.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers will readily remember the curious explanation which takes
place between Bauldy, the old-world shepherd, in the Introduction to
this tale, and Mr. Peter Pattieson, respecting the difference between
<i>lang</i> sheep and <i>short</i> sheep. We can attest, from unexceptionable
authority, that a conversation once actually took place between Sir
Walter Scott, James Hogg, and Mr. Laidlaw, the <i>factor</i> of the former,
in which the same disquisition and nearly the same words occurred.
Messrs. H. and L. began the dispute about the various merits of the
different sheep; and many references being made to the respective
<i>lengths</i> of the animals, Sir Walter became quite tired of their unintelligible
technicals, and very simply asked them how sheep came to
be distinguished by longitude, having, he observed, never perceived
any remarkable difference between one sheep and another in that
particular. It was then that an explanation took place, very like that
of Bauldy in the Introduction; and we think there can be no doubt
that the fictitious incident would never have taken place but for the
real circumstance we have related.</p>

<p>The dispute with Christy Wilson, butcher in Gandercleugh, which it
was the object of Bauldy’s master to settle, and in consequence of
which being amicably adjusted, the convivialities that brought out from
the shepherd the materials of the tale were entered into, has, we understand,
its origin in a process once before the Court of Session, respecting
what is termed a <i>luck-penny</i> on a bargain.</p>

<h3>DAVID RITCHIE.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Elshender the Recluse.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> particulars of David Ritchie’s life, which are in themselves
sufficiently meagre, have been more than once already laid before
the public. In <i>Blackwood’s Monthly Magazine</i> for June, and in the
<i>Edinburgh Magazine</i> for October, 1817, accounts of the supposed
original of the Black Dwarf are given, evidently from no mean
authority, if we may judge from the style in which these narratives
are written. A separate production, also, of a very interesting nature,
embellished with a striking and singularly correct likeness of the
dwarf, appeared in 1820, and comprised every anecdote of this
singular being previously uncollected. It is therefore conceived totally
unnecessary to detail at any length a subject which, independent of
its want of elegance and interest, has been already so completely
exhausted. To give a few sketches of the character and habits of
David Ritchie, and contrast them with those of the more sublime
Elshender, will, it is hoped, prove a more grateful entertainment.</p>

<p>David Ritchie was a pauper, who lived the greater part of a long
life, and finally died so late as the year 1811, in a solitary cottage
situated in the romantic glen of Manor in Peebles-shire. This vale,
now rendered classic ground by the abode of the Black Dwarf, was
otherwise formerly remarkable as having been the retirement of the
illustrious and venerable Professor Ferguson.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>His person coincided singularly well with the description of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">{78}</span>
fictitious recluse. He had been deformed and horrible since his birth
in no ordinary degree, which was probably the cause of the analogous
peculiarities of his temper. His countenance, of the darkest of dark
complexions, was half covered with a long grisly black beard, and
bore, as the centre of its system of terrors, two eyes of piercing black,
which were sometimes, in his excited moments, lighted up with wild
and supernatural lustre. His head was of a singular shape, conical
and oblong, and might now form no unworthy subject for the studies
of the Phrenological Society. To speak in their language, he must
have had few of the moral or intellectual faculties developed in any
perfection; for his brow retreated immediately above the eyebrows,
and threw nearly the whole of his head, which was large, behind the
ear, where, it is said, the meaner organs of the brain are situated—giving
immense scope to cruelty, obstinacy, self-esteem, etc. His nose
was long and aquiline; his mouth wide and contemptuously curled
upward; and his chin protruded from the visage in a long grisly peak.
His body, short and muscular, was thicker than that of most ordinary
men, and, with his arms, which were long and of great power, might
have formed the parts of a giant, had not nature capriciously curtailed
his form of other limbs conformable to these proportions. His arms
had the same defect with those of the celebrated Betterton, and he
could not lift them higher than his breast; yet such was their strength,
that he has been known to tear up a tree by the roots, which had
baffled the united efforts of two labourers, who had striven by digging
to eradicate it. His legs were short, fin-like, and bent outwards, with
feet totally inapplicable to the common purposes of walking. These
he constantly endeavoured to conceal from sight by wrapping them up
in immense masses of rags. This ungainly part of his figure is remarkable
as the only one which differs materially from the description of
“Cannie Elshie,” whose “body, thick and square, was mounted upon
two large feet.”</p>

<p>He was the son of very poor parents, who, at an early period of his
life, endeavoured to place him with a tradesman in the metropolis to
learn the humble art of brushmaking; which purpose he however soon
deserted in disgust, on account of the insupportable notice which his
uncouth form attracted in the streets. His spirit, perhaps, also panted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">{79}</span>
for the seclusion of his native hills, where he might have ease to indulge
in that solitude so appropriate to the outcast ugliness of his person, and
free from the insulting gaze of vulgar curiosity. Here, in the valley of
his birth, he formed the romantic project of building a small hut for
himself, in which, like the Recluse of the tale, he might live for ever
retired from the race for whose converse he was unfitted, and give
unrestrained scope to the moods of his misanthropy. He constructed
this hermitage in precisely the same manner with the Black Dwarf of
Mucklestane Moor. Huge rocks, which he had rolled down from the
neighbouring hill, formed the foundation and walls, to which an
alternate layer of turf, as is commonly used in cottages, gave almost
the consistency and fully the comfort of mortar. He is said to have
evinced amazing bodily strength in moving and placing these stones,
such as the strongest men, with all the advantages of stature and
muscular proportion, could hardly have equalled. This corporeal
energy, which lay chiefly in his arms, will remind the reader of the
exertions of the Black Dwarf, as witnessed by Hobbie Elliot and
young Earnscliff, on the morning after his first appearance, when
employed in arranging the foundations of his hermitage out of the Grey
Geese of Mucklestane Moor.—<i>See</i> pp. 78, 79.</p>

<p>When the young hermit had finished his hut, and succeeded in
furnishing it with a few coarse household utensils, framed chiefly by his
own hands, he began to form a garden. In the cultivation and adornment
of this spot, he displayed a degree of natural taste and ingenuity
that might have fitted him for a higher fate than the seclusion of a
hermitage. In a short time he had stocked it with such a profusion of
fruit-trees, herbs, vegetables, and flowers, that it seemed a little forest
of beauty—a shred of Eden, fit to redeem the wilderness around from
its character of desolation—a gem on the swarth brow of the desert.
Not only did it exhibit the finest specimens of flowers indigenous to this
country, but he had also contrived to procure a number of exotics,
whose Linnæan names he would roll forth to the friends whom he indulged
with an admission within its precincts, with a pomposity of
voice that never failed to enhance their admiration. It soon came to
be much resorted to by visitors, being accounted, with <i>the genius of
the place</i>, one of the most remarkable curiosities of the county. Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">{80}</span>
Ferguson used sometimes to visit the eccentric solitary, as an amusement
in that retired spot; and Sir Walter Scott, who was a frequent
guest at the house of that venerable gentleman, is said to have often
held long communings with him; likewise several other individuals of
literary celebrity.</p>

<p>There is something more peculiarly romantic and poetical in the
circumstance of the Misanthrope’s attachment to his garden than can
be found in any of the other habits and qualities attributed to him.
The care of that beautiful spot was his chief occupation, and may be
said to have been the only pleasure his life was ever permitted to experience.
On it alone he could employ that <i>faculty</i> of affection with
which every heart, even that of the cynic, is endowed. Shut out from
the correspondence and sympathy of his own fellow-creatures by the
insurmountable pale of his own ugliness, there existed, in the whole
circle of nature, no other object that could receive his affections, or
reply to the feelings he had to impart. In flowers alone, those lineal
and undegenerate descendants of Paradise, the Solitary found an object
of attachment that could do equal honour to his feelings and to his
taste. His garden was a perfect seraglio of vegetable beauties, and
<i>there</i> he could commune with a thousand objects of affection, that never
shrunk from the touch which threatened horror and pollution to all the
world beside.</p>

<p>By the peculiarities of his person, as well as by the other abject circumstances
of his condition, it may be easily supposed that the Hermit
of Manor was entirely excluded from that great solace of the miseries of
man, the sympathy to be derived from the tenderness and affections of
woman. He was irredeemably condemned, as it were, to a dreary
bachelorhood of the heart, which knew that there was for it no hope,
no possibility of enjoyment. Perhaps the constant sense of loathsomeness
in the eyes of the fair part of creation might help to increase the
natural wretchedness of his existence. The misanthropy of Elshender
is pathetically represented in the tale as springing chiefly from sources
of disappointment like this. It happens, also, that his humble prototype
once ventured to express the sensibilities of the common delirium
of man, and that he was rejected by the object of his affection. This
insult, though it sprung from a very natural feeling on the part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">{81}</span>
woman, sunk deep into his heart; and thus was he debarred from what
would have been the only means of sweetening the bitter lot of solitary
poverty and decrepitude,—dashed back with scorn from the general
draught at which even his inferiors were liberally indulged. This circumstance
forms another trait of resemblance between the Black Dwarf
and David Ritchie; and, by a happy consonance never before discovered,
confirms their identity.</p>

<p>“His habits were, in many respects, singular, and indicated a mind
sufficiently congenial with its uncouth tabernacle. A jealous, misanthropical,
and irritable temper was his most prominent characteristic.
The sense of his deformity haunted him like a phantom; and the
insults and scorn to which this exposed him had poisoned his heart
with fierce and bitter feelings, which, from other traits in his character,
do not appear to have been more largely infused into his original temperament
than that of his fellow-men. He detested children, on
account of their propensity to insult and persecute him. To strangers
he was generally reserved, crabbed, and surly; and even towards persons
who had been his greatest benefactors, and who possessed the
greatest share of his good-will, he frequently betrayed much caprice
and jealousy. A lady, who knew him from his infancy, says, that,
although he showed as much attachment and respect for her father’s
family as it was in his nature to show for any, yet they were always
obliged to be very cautious in their deportment towards him.
One day, having gone to visit him with another lady, he took them
through his garden, and was showing them, with much pride and
good-humour, all his rich and tastefully assorted borders, here picking
up with his long staff some insidious weed, and there turning to digress
into the history of some mysterious exotic, when they happened to stop
near a plot of cabbages, which had been somewhat injured by the
caterpillars. Davie, observing one of the ladies smile, instantly assumed
a savage scowling aspect, rushed among the cabbages, and
dashed them to pieces with his <i>kent</i>, exclaiming, ‘I hate the worms,
for they mock me!’”</p>

<p>When he visited the neighbouring metropolis of the county, which
happened very seldom towards the latter part of his life, he was
generally followed by crowds of boys, who hooted and insulted him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">{82}</span>
with all that disregard of feeling and insolence of wickedness so often
to be observed in children of the lower ranks in Scottish villages. On
these occasions he was wont to give his persecutors the “length of his
<i>kent</i>,” as he called it, when he could reach them; but they being
generally too nimble for his crippled evolutions, he had often to vent
his revenge in the more harmless form of curses. These were frequently
of the most terrific and unusual kind. He is even said to have
evinced something like <i>genius</i> in the invention of his imprecations,
some of which far surpassed Gray’s celebrated</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ruin seize thee, ruthless King!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He would swear he would “cleave them to the <i>harn-pans</i>, if he had
but his <i>cran</i> fingers on them;” that he “could pour seething lead
down their throats;” that “hell would never be full till they were in
it;” and frequently exclaimed that there was nothing he would “like
so well as to see their souls girnin’ for a thousand eternities on the red-het
brander o’ the de’il!”</p>

<p>Among the traits of his character, there is none reminds us so
strongly of the Misanthrope of the tale as this propensity to execration.
The same style of discourse, and almost the same terms of
imprecation, are common to both. The <i>Mighty Unknown</i> has put
expressions into the mouth of this character which, as specimens of
the grand and sublime, are altogether unequalled in the whole circle
of English poetry—not even excepting the magnificent thunders of
Byron’s muse. Now, his prototype is well remembered, by those who
have conversed with him, to have frequently used language which,
sometimes sinking to delicacy and even elegance, and at others rising
to a very tempest of execration and diabolical expression, might have
been deemed almost miraculous from <i>his</i> mouth, could it not have been
attributed partly to the impassioned inspiration that naturally flowed
from his consciousness of deformity, from keen resentment of insult,
and from the despairing, loveless sterility of his heart.</p>

<p>The history of his death-bed furnishes us with an anecdote of a
beautiful and atoning character.</p>

<p>He had always through life expressed the utmost abhorrence of being
buried among what he haughtily termed the “<i>common brush</i>” in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">{83}</span>
parish churchyard, and pointed out a particular spot, in the neighbourhood
of his cottage, where he had been frequently known to lie
dreaming or reading for long summer days, as a more agreeable place
of interment. It is remarked by a former biographer, that he has displayed
no small portion of taste in the selection of this spot. It is the
summit of a small rising ground, called the Woodhill, situated nearly in
the centre of the parish of Manor, covered with green fern, and embowered
on the top by a circle of <i>rowan-trees</i> planted by the Dwarf’s
own hand, for the double purpose of serving as a mausoleum or monument
to his memory, and keeping away, by the charm of consecration
supposed to be vested in their nature, the influence of witchcraft and
other unhallowed powers from the grave.</p>

<p>All around this romantic spot the waste features of a mountainous
country bound the horizon, presenting a striking contrast to the fertile
beauty of the intermediate valley, and withal capable of suggesting to
the enthusiastic and imaginative mind of the Solitary, the idea of <i>this</i>
scene being a more desirable grave, sacred as it was in the grandeur of
Nature, than the merely <i>Christian</i> ground of a country churchyard.
“What!” the proud unsocial soul of the misanthrope might perhaps
think—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">“What! to be decently interred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In a churchyard, and mingle my brave dust</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Surfeit-slain fools, the common dung o’ th’ soil!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nevertheless, whatever might have been his sentiments regarding the
dead among whom, during his days of health, he loathed to be placed,
certain it is, that, when brought within view and feeling of the awful
close of mortal existence, his heart was softened towards his fellow-men,
his antipathies relaxed, and he died with a wish upon his lips to be
buried among his fathers.</p>

<p>In 1820, the writer of the present narrative visited the deserted hut
of “Bowed Davie,” actuated by a sort of pilgrim-respect for scenes
hallowed by genius. The little mansion at present existing is not that
built by the Dwarf’s own hands, but one of later date, erected by the
charity of a neighbouring gentleman in the year 1802. A small tablet
of freestone, bearing this date below the letters D. R. was still to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">{84}</span>
seen in the western gable. The eastern division of the cottage,
separated from the other by a partition of stone and lime, and entering
by a different door, was still inhabited by his sister. It is remarkable
that even with that near relation he was never on terms of any affection;
an almost complete estrangement having subsisted between these
two lonely beings for many years. Agnes had been a servant in the
earlier part of her life; but having of late years become subject to a
degree of mental aberration, she had retired from every sort of employment
to her brother’s habitation, where she subsisted on the charity of
the poor’s funds.</p>

<p>On entering the cottage with my guide, we found her seated on a low
settle before the fire, her hands reclined upon her lap, and her eyes
gazing unmeaningly on a small turf fire, which died away in a perfect
wilderness of chimney. Her whole figure and situation reminded me
strongly of the inimitable description of the lone Highland woman in
Hogg’s “Winter Evening Tales,” who sat singing by the light of a
moss-lamp in expectation of the apparition of her son. The scene was
nearly as wild and picturesque, the wretched inmate of the hut was as
lonely and helpless, and there was an air of desolate imbecility about
her that rendered her almost as interesting. It seemed surprising, indeed,
how a person apparently so abandoned by her own energies and
the care of her fellow-creatures, could at all exist in such a solitude.
She neither moved nor looked up on our entrance; but a few minutes
after we had seated ourselves, which we did with silence and awe, she
lifted her eyes, and thereby gave us a fuller view of her countenance.
She much resembled her brother in features, but was not deformed.
Her face was dark with age and wretchedness, and her aspect, otherwise
somewhat appalling, was rendered almost unearthly by two large
black eyes, the lustre of which was not the less horrible by the imbecility
of their gaze. I have been thus particular in describing her
person and circumstances, because I do not judge it impossible that she
may have suggested the original idea of Elspeth Cheyne, the superannuated
dependant of Glenallan, in the “Antiquary.”</p>

<p>Through the medium of my guide, a sagacious country lad, I
contrived to ask her a number of questions concerning her brother;
but she was extremely shy in answering them, and expressed her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">{85}</span>
jealousy of my intentions by saying, “she wondered why so many
grand people had come from distant parts to inquire after her family—she
was sure there was naething <i>ill</i> anent them.” Little did she,
poor soul, understand the cause of this curiosity, or the honour conferred
upon her family by the attention of the great <i>hermit-author</i>,
in whose works the very mention of a name confers immortality.</p>

<p>She showed us her brother’s Bible. It was of Kincaid’s fine quarto
edition, and had been bought in 1773 by the Dwarf himself. His
name was written with his own hand on a blank leaf, and it was with
something like transport that I drew a fac-simile of the autograph
into my pocket-book, which I still preserve.</p>

<p>Agnes Ritchie died in December, 1821, ten years after the decease
of her brother, and was buried in the same grave, in Manor churchyard,
on which occasion the deformed bones of Bowed Davie were found,
to the utter disproof of a vulgar report, that they had suffered resurrection
at the hands of certain anatomists in the College of Glasgow.</p>

<p>I found the part of the house which had been inhabited by the
Dwarf himself deserted as he had left it at his death. Its furniture
had been all dispersed among the curious or the friendly; and a host
of poultry were now suffered to roost on the rafters where only soot
formerly dared to hang. His seat of divination before the door had
been suffered to remain. It was covered very rurally with a ruinous
<i>door of a cart</i>. There seemed no precise window in the hut, but it
contained numerous holes and bores all round, some of which were
built up with turf. I drew a pair of rusty nails from a joist near the
door, and, wrapping them up in a piece of paper, brought them away.</p>

<p>We stole a look at the garden, by climbing up the high wall.
Some care has been taken by the neighbouring peasants to preserve
it in good order; but, alas! it is scarcely the ghost of what it was:
“Cum Troja fuit,” there was not a weed to be seen over its whole
surface, nor durst a single <i>kail-worm</i> intrude its unhallowed nose
within the precincts; an hundred mountain-ashes, displaying their red,
sour fruit to the temptation of the passing urchin, stood around like a
guard, to preserve from the influence of witchcraft the richer treasures
that lay within,—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fair as the gardens of <i>Gul</i> in their bloom”;</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">{86}</span></p>
<p>but now weeds and kail-worms were abundant, the rowan-trees had
been all cut down, and Bowed Davie’s garden, that once might have
rivalled Milton’s imagination of Paradise, now lay stale, flat, and
unprofitable—like a buxom cheek deprived of its blushes, or Greece
deserted by the liberty that once, according to Byron, <i>inspired</i> its
beauty. A few <i>skeps</i>, however, still remained, which the neighbouring
Hobbie Elliots had <i>not</i> taken away.</p>

<p>It was a curious trait in the character of David Ritchie, that he was
very superstitious. Not only had he planted his house, his garden,
and even his intended grave, all round with the mountain-ash, but it
is also well authenticated that he never went abroad without a branch
of this singular antidote, tied round with a <i>red thread</i>, in his pocket, to
prevent the effects of the <i>evil eye</i>. When the <i>sancta sanctorum</i> of his
domicile were so sacrilegiously ransacked after his death, there was
found an elf-stone, or small round pebble, bored in the centre, hung
by a cord of hair passed through the hole to the head of his bed!</p>

<p>After taking the foregoing view of the Wizard’s fairy bower, I was
next conducted to his grave, which lies in the immediate vicinity. A
slip of his favourite rowan-tree marked the spot. It had been planted
several years after his death by some kindly hand, and, in the absence
of a less perishable monument, seemed a wonderful act of delicacy and
attention. It spoke a pathos to the feelings that the finest inscription
could not have excited,—it was so consonant with the former desires of
“the poor inhabitant below!”</p>

<p>In allusion to the foregoing circumstances, the following verses were
composed, and inserted in a periodical publication:—</p>

<h3>DESERTED BURYING-GROUND.</h3>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe4_4375" id="i_p_088">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_088.jpg" alt="T" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">here</span> exists, in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, a scene nearly
resembling that described in the beautiful preliminary to this Tale,
as the burying-ground of the Covenanters. It is commonly called
St. Catherine’s Kirkyard, and is all that remains of the chapel and
cemetery of the once celebrated <i>St. Catherine’s in the Hopes</i>.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The
situation is particularly pastoral, beautiful, and interesting. It is
placed where the narrow ravine, down which Glencorse burn descends,
opens up into an expanse considerably wider. Rullion Green, where
the Covenanters were defeated by the troops of Charles II. in 1665,
was in the immediate vicinity; and tradition still points out in St.
Catherine’s the graves of several of the insurgents, who were killed
either in the battle or near this spot in the pursuit. If the latter be
the most probable fact, no other circumstance would be required to
establish the identity of the two scenes.</p>

<p>St. Catherine’s Churchyard, lying among the wildest solitudes of the
Pentland Hills, is an object of beautiful and interesting desolation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">{89}</span>
almost equal to the scene of Peter Pattieson’s meeting with Old Mortality.
There does not now remain the least trace of a place of
worship within its precincts; and it seems to have been long disused as
a place of interment. A slight mark of an inclosure, nearly level with
the sward, and one overgrown gravestone, itself almost in the grave,
are all that point out the spot.</p>

<p>The ground in which St. Catherine’s is situated agrees in certain
general circumstances with the author’s Vale of Gandercleugh. The
horrific “<i>dry-stane dike</i>” projected by “his honour the Laird of
Gusedub,” does not, it is true, appear to have ever substituted its
rectilinear deformity for the graceful winding of the natural boundary,
as the too-poetical Peter Pattieson apprehended. But a circumstance
has taken place by which the romantic has been sacrificed to the useful
as completely as if “his honour” had fulfilled his intention. The
ravine, at the head of which St. Catherine’s is situated, has lately been
embanked, and laid completely under water, as a compensation-pond
for the mills upon the Crawley Burn, of which the more legitimate
supplies were cut off, and turned towards a different direction and very
different purpose, by being carried to Edinburgh for the use of the
inhabitants.</p>

<p>Besides being <i>possibly</i> the original scene of the Deserted Burying-Ground,
this spot is not otherwise destitute of the qualification of
<i>classic</i>. At no great distance stands Logan House, the supposed mansion
of <i>Sir William Worthy</i> of the “Gentle Shepherd”; and at the
head of the glen lies what has generally been considered the “<i>Habbie’s
How</i>” of that drama.</p>

<p>In the leading article of the <i>Scotsman</i>, September 3, 1823, the writer
endeavours to trace a similarity between the Vale of Glencorse and the
description of Glendearg in the Monastery.</p>


<h3>VALE OF GANDERCLEUGH.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Vale of Gandercleugh may perhaps have been suggested by Lesmahagow,
a village and parish in the west country, not far from Drumclog.
In the churchyard are interred several of the Covenanters,—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">{90}</span>
particular, David Steel, who was slain by Captain Crichton, the
cavalier whose life was written by Swift—in a note to which Sir
Walter Scott mentions Old Mortality as having for a long time preserved
Steel’s grave-stone from decay.</p>


<h3 title="HISTORY OF THE PERIOD.">HISTORY OF THE PERIOD.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></h3>

<p>“<span class="smcap">We</span> have observed the early antipathy mutually entertained by the
Scottish Presbyterians and the House of Stuart. It seems to have
glowed in the breast even of the good-natured Charles II. He might
have remembered that, in 1651, the Presbyterians had fought, bled,
and ruined themselves in his cause. But he rather recollected their
early faults than their late repentance; and even their services were
combined with the recollection of the absurd and humiliating circumstances
of personal degradation,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> to which their pride had subjected
him, while they professed to espouse his cause. As a man of pleasure,
he hated their stern inflexible rigour, which stigmatized follies even
more deeply than crimes; and he whispered to his confidants, that,
‘therefore, it was not wonderful that, in the first year of his restoration,
he formally re-established prelacy in Scotland.’ But it is surprising
that, with his father’s example before his eyes, he should not
have been satisfied to leave at freedom the consciences of those who
could not reconcile themselves to the new system. The religious
opinions of sectaries have a tendency, like the water of some springs,
to become soft and mild when freely exposed to open day. Who can
recognise, in the decent and industrious Quakers and Anabaptists, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">{91}</span>
wild and ferocious tenets which distinguished their sects while yet they
were honoured with the distinction of the scourge and the pillory?
Had the system of coercion against the Presbyterians been continued
until our day, Blair and Robertson would have preached in the wilderness,
and only discovered their powers of eloquence and composition,
by rolling along a deeper torrent of gloomy fanaticism.</p>

<p>“The western counties distinguished themselves by their opposition
to the prelatic system. Three hundred and fifty ministers, ejected from
their churches and livings, wandered through the mountains, sowing
the seeds of covenanted doctrine, while multitudes of fanatical followers
pursued them, to reap the forbidden crop. These Conventicles, as they
were called, were denounced by the law, and their frequenters dispersed
by military force. The genius of the persecuted became stubborn,
obstinate, and ferocious; and, although Indulgences were tardily
granted to some Presbyterian ministers, few of the true Covenanters,
or Whigs, as they were called, would condescend to compound with
a prelatic government, or to listen even to their own favourite doctrine
under the auspices of the King. From Richard Cameron, their
apostle, this rigid sect acquired the name of Cameronians. They
preached and prayed against the Indulgence, and against the Presbyterians
who availed themselves of it, because their accepting of this
royal boon was a tacit acknowledgment of the King’s supremacy in
ecclesiastical matters.</p>

<p>“Upon these bigoted and persecuted fanatics, and by no means
upon the Presbyterians at large, are to be charged the wild anarchical
principles of anti-monarchy and assassination which polluted the period
when they flourished.</p>

<p>“The Conventicles were now attended by armed crowds; and a
formidable insurrection took place in the west, and rolled on towards
the capital. It was terminated by a defeat at the Pentland Hills,
where General Dalziel routed the insurgents with great loss, 28th
November, 1666.</p>

<p>“The Whigs, now become desperate, adopted the most desperate
principles; and retaliating, as far as they could, the intolerating persecution
which they endured, they openly disclaimed allegiance to any
monarch who should not profess presbytery and subscribe the covenant.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">{92}</span>
These principles were not likely to conciliate the favour of government,
and, as we wade onward in the history of the times, the scenes
become yet darker. At length, one would imagine the parties had
agreed to divide the kingdom of vice between them,—the hunters assuming
to themselves open profligacy and legalized oppression, and the
hunted the opposite attributes of hypocrisy, fanaticism, disloyalty, and
midnight assassination. The troopers and cavaliers became enthusiasts
in the pursuit of the Covenanters. If Messrs. Kid, King, Cameron,
Peden, etc., boasted of prophetic powers, and were often warned of
the approach of the soldiers by supernatural impulse, Captain John
Crichton, on the other side, dreamed dreams and saw visions, (chiefly,
indeed, after having drunk hard,) in which the lurking-holes of the
rebels were discovered to his imagination.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>“Our ears are scarcely more shocked with the profane execration
of the persecutors<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> than with the strange and insolent familiarity used
towards the Deity by the persecuted fanatics. Their indecent modes
of prayer, their extravagant expectations of miraculous assistance, and
their supposed inspirations, might easily furnish out a tale, at which
the good would sigh and the gay would laugh.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>“The militia and standing army soon became unequal to the task
of enforcing conformity and suppressing Conventicles. In their aid,
and to force compliance with a test proposed by government, the
Highland clans were raised, and poured down into Ayrshire; and armed
hosts of undisciplined mountaineers, speaking a different language,
and professing, many of them, another religion, were let loose to
ravage and plunder this unfortunate country; and it is truly astonishing
to find how few acts of cruelty they perpetrated, and how seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">{93}</span>
they added murder to pillage. Additional levies of horse were also
raised, under the name of independent troops, and great part of them
placed under the command of James Grahame of Claverhouse, a man
well known to fame by his subsequent title of Viscount of Dundee, but
better remembered in the western shires under the designation of the
bloody Clavers.</p>

<p>“In truth, he appears to have combined the virtues and vices of
a savage chief. Fierce, unbending, and rigorous, no emotion of compassion
prevented his commanding and witnessing every detail of
military execution against the Nonconformists. Undoubtedly brave,
and steadily faithful to his prince, he sacrificed himself in the cause of
James when he was deserted by all the world. The Whigs whom he
persecuted, daunted by his ferocity and courage, conceived him to be
impassive to their bullets, and that he had sold himself, for temporal
greatness, to the seducer of mankind. It is still believed, that a cup of
wine, presented to him by his butler, changed into clotted blood; and
that, when he plunged his feet into cold water, their touch caused it to
boil. The steed which bore him was supposed to be the gift of Satan;
and precipices are shown where a fox could hardly keep his feet, down
which the infernal charger conveyed him safely in pursuit of the
wanderers. It is remembered with terror that Claverhouse was successful
in every engagement with the Whigs, except that at Drumclog,
or Loudon Hill. The history of Burly will bring us immediately to
the causes and circumstances of that event.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">John Balfour</span> of Kinloch, commonly called <span class="smcap">Burly</span>, was one of
the fiercest of the proscribed sect. A gentleman by birth, he was,
says his biographer, ‘zealous and honest-hearted, courageous in every
enterprise, and a brave soldier—seldom any escaping that came into
his hands.’</p>

<p>“Crichton says that he was once chamberlain to Archbishop
Sharpe, and, by negligence or dishonesty, had incurred a large arrear,
which occasioned his being active in his master’s assassination. But
of this I know no other evidence than Crichton’s assertion and a hint
in Wodrow. Burly, for that is his common designation, was brother-in-law
to Hackston of Rathillet, a wild, enthusiastic character, who
joined daring courage and skill in the sword to the fiery zeal of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">{94}</span>
sect. Burly himself was less eminent for religious fervour than for
the active and violent share which he had in the most desperate
enterprises of his party. His name does not appear among the
Covenanters who were denounced for the affair at Pentland. But, in
1677, Robert Hamilton, afterwards commander of the insurgents
at Loudon Hill and Bothwell Bridge, with several other Nonconformists,
were assembled at this Burly’s house, in Fife. There they
were attacked by a party of soldiers, commanded by Captain Carstairs,
whom they beat off, and wounded desperately one of his party. For
this resistance to authority they were declared rebels.</p>

<p>“The next exploit in which Burly was engaged was of a bloodier
complexion and more dreadful celebrity. It was well known that
James Sharpe, Archbishop of St. Andrew’s, was regarded by the
rigid Presbyterians not only as a renegade, who had turned back from
the spiritual plough, but as the principal author of the rigours exercised
against their sect. He employed, as an agent of his oppression, one
Carmichael, a decayed gentleman. The industry of this man in procuring
information, and in enforcing the severe penalties against
Conventiclers, having excited the resentment of the Cameronians, nine
of their number, of whom Burly and his brother-in-law, Hackston,
were the leaders, assembled, with the purpose of waylaying and
murdering Carmichael; but, while they searched for him in vain, they
received tidings that the Archbishop himself was at hand. The party
resorted to prayer, after which they agreed, unanimously, that the
Lord had delivered the wicked Haman into their hands. In the
execution of the supposed will of heaven, they agreed to put themselves
under the command of a leader, and they requested Hackston
of Rathillet to accept the office; which he declined, alleging, that,
should he comply with their request, the slaughter might be imputed
to a private quarrel which existed betwixt him and the Archbishop.
The command was then offered to Burly, who accepted it without
scruple; and they galloped off in pursuit of the Archbishop’s carriage,
which contained himself and his daughter. Being well mounted, they
easily overtook and disarmed the prelate’s attendants. Burly, crying
out, ‘Judas, be taken!’ rode up to the carriage, wounded the postilion,
and hamstrung one of the horses. He then fired into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">{95}</span>
coach a piece, charged with several bullets, so near, that the Archbishop’s
gown was set on fire. The rest, coming up, dismounted,
and dragged him out of the carriage, when, frightened and wounded,
he crawled towards Hackston, who still remained on horseback, and
begged for mercy. The stern enthusiast contented himself with
answering, that he would not himself lay a hand on him. Burly and
his men again fired a volley upon the kneeling old man, and were in
the act of riding off, when one, who remained to fasten the girth of
his horse, unfortunately heard the daughter of their victim call to the
servant for help, exclaiming that his master was still alive. Burly
then again dismounted, struck off the prelate’s hat with his foot, and
cleft his skull with his shable, (broadsword,) although one of the party
(probably Rathillet,) exclaimed, ‘Spare these grey hairs!’ The rest
pierced him with repeated wounds. They plundered the carriage, and
rode off, leaving, beside the mangled corpse, the daughter, who was
herself wounded in her pious endeavour to interpose betwixt her father
and his murderers. The murder is accurately represented in bas-relief,
upon a beautiful monument, erected to the memory of Archbishop
Sharpe, in the metropolitan church of St. Andrew’s. This memorable
example of fanatic revenge was acted upon Magus Muir, near St.
Andrew’s, 3rd May, 1679.</p>

<p>“Burly was of course obliged to leave Fife; and, upon the 25th of
the same month, he arrived in Evandale, in Lanarkshire, along with
Hackston, and a fellow called Dingwall, or Daniel, one of the same
bloody band. Here he joined his old friend Hamilton, already mentioned;
and, as they resolved to take up arms, they were soon at the
head of such a body of the ‘chased-and-tossed western men’ as they
thought equal to keep the field. They resolved to commence their
exploits upon 29th May, 1674, being the anniversary of the Restoration,
appointed to be kept a holiday by Act of Parliament—an
institution which they esteemed a presumptuous and unholy solemnity.
Accordingly, at the head of eighty horse, tolerably appointed,
Hamilton, Burly, and Hackston entered the royal burgh of Rutherglen,
extinguished the bonfires made in honour of the day, burned at the
cross the Acts of Parliament in favour of prelacy and suppression
of Conventicles, as well as those acts of council which regulated the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">{96}</span>
Indulgence granted to Presbyterians. Against all these acts they
entered their solemn protest, or testimony, as they called it; and,
having affixed it to the cross, concluded with prayer and psalms. Being
now joined by a large body of foot, so that their strength seems to
have amounted to five or six hundred men, though very indifferently
armed, they encamped upon Loudon Hill. Claverhouse, who was
in the garrison of Glasgow, instantly marched against the insurgents,
at the head of his own troop of cavalry and others, amounting to about
one hundred and fifty men. He arrived at Hamilton, on the 1st of
June, so unexpectedly, as to make prisoner John King, a famous
preacher among the wanderers, and rapidly continued his march,
carrying his captive along with him, till he came to the village of
Drumclog, about a mile east of Loudon Hill, and twelve miles south-west
of Hamilton. At the same distance from this place, the insurgents
were skilfully posted in a boggy strait, almost inaccessible to cavalry,
having a broad ditch in their front. Claverhouse’s dragoons discharged
their carbines, and made an attempt to charge. Burly, who commanded
the handful of horse belonging to the Whigs, instantly led
them down on the disordered squadrons of Claverhouse, who were, at
the same time, vigorously assaulted by the foot, headed by the gallant
Cleland and the enthusiastic Hackston. Claverhouse himself was
forced to fly, and was in the utmost danger of being taken, his horse’s
belly being cut open by the stroke of a scythe, so that the poor animal
trailed his bowels for more than a mile. In this flight he passed King,
the minister, lately his prisoner, but now deserted by his guard in the
general confusion. The preacher hallooed to the flying commander
‘to halt and take his prisoner with him;’ or, as others say, ‘to stay
and take the afternoon’s preaching.’ Claverhouse, at length remounted,
continued his retreat to Glasgow. He lost in the skirmish
about twenty of his troopers, and his own cornet and kinsman, Robert
Grahame. Only four of the other side were killed, among whom was
Dingwall, or Daniel, an associate of Burly in Sharpe’s murder. ‘The
rebels,’ says Crichton, ‘finding the cornet’s body, and supposing it
to be that of Clavers, because the name of Grahame was wrought in
the shirt-neck, treated it with the utmost inhumanity—cutting off
his nose, picking out his eyes, and stabbing it through in a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">{97}</span>
places.’ The same charge is brought by Guild, in his <i>Bellum Bothwellianum</i>,
in which occurs the following account of the skirmish at
Drumclog:—</p>

<p>“‘Although Burly was among the most active leaders in the action,
he was not the commander-in-chief. That honour belonged to Robert
Hamilton, brother of Sir William Hamilton of Preston, a gentleman
who, like most of those at Drumclog, had imbibed the very wildest
principles of fanaticism. The Cameronian account of the insurrection
states, that “Mr. Hamilton discovered a great deal of bravery and
valour, both in the conflict with, and pursuit of, the enemy; but when
he and some others were pursuing the enemy, others flew too greedily
upon the spoil, small as it was, instead of pursuing the victory; and
some, without Mr. Hamilton’s knowledge, and against his strict command,
gave five of these bloody enemies quarter, and let them go.
This greatly grieved Mr. Hamilton, when he saw some of Babel’s brats
spared, after the Lord had delivered them into their hands, that they
might dash them against the stones (Psalm cxxxvii. 9). In his own
account of this, he reckons the sparing of these enemies, and letting
them go, to be among their first steppings aside, for which he feared
that the Lord would not honour them to do much more for them, and
says that he was neither for taking favours from, nor giving favours to,
the Lord’s enemies.” Burly was not a likely man to fall into this sort
of backsliding. He disarmed one of the Duke of Hamilton’s servants
in the action, and desired him to tell his master he would keep, till
meeting, the pistols he had taken from him. The man described
Burly to the Duke as a little stout man, squint-eyed, and of a most
ferocious aspect; from which it appears that Burly’s figure corresponded
to his manners, and perhaps gave rise to his nickname, <i>Burly</i>
signifying <i>strong</i>. He was with the insurgents till the battle of
Bothwell Bridge, and afterwards fled to Holland. He joined the
Prince of Orange, but died at sea during the passage. The Cameronians
still believe he had obtained liberty from the Prince to be
avenged of those who had persecuted the Lord’s people; but, through
his death, the laudable design of purging the land with their blood is
supposed to have fallen to the ground.’</p>

<p>“It has often been remarked, that the Scottish, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">{98}</span>
their national courage, were always unsuccessful when fighting for
their religion. The cause lay not in the principle, but in the mode of
its application. A leader, like Mahomet, who is, at the same time,
the prophet of his tribe, may avail himself of religious enthusiasm,
because it comes to the aid of discipline, and is a powerful means of
attaining the despotic command essential to the success of a general.
But among the insurgents in the reign of the last Stuarts, were mingled
preachers, who taught different shades of the Presbyterian doctrine;
and, minute as these shades sometimes were, neither the several
shepherds nor their flocks could unite in a common cause. This will
appear from the transactions leading to the battle of Bothwell
Bridge.</p>

<p>“We have seen that the party which defeated Claverhouse at Loudon
Hill were Cameronians, whose principles consisted in disowning
all temporal authority which did not flow from and through the Solemn
League and Covenant. This doctrine, which is still retained by a
scattered remnant of the sect in Scotland, is in theory, and would be
in practice, inconsistent with the safety of any well-regulated government,
because the Covenanters deny to their governors that toleration
which was iniquitously refused to themselves.</p>

<p>“In many respects, therefore, we cannot be surprised at the anxiety
and vigour with which the Cameronians were persecuted, although we
may be of opinion that milder means would have induced a melioration
of their principles. These men, as already noticed, excepted
against such Presbyterians as were contented to exercise their worship
under the Indulgence granted by government, or, in other words, who
would have been satisfied with toleration for themselves, without
insisting on a revolution in the state, or even in the Church government.</p>

<p>“When, however, the success at Loudon Hill was spread abroad, a
number of preachers, gentlemen, and common people, who had
embraced the more moderate doctrine, joined the army of Hamilton,
thinking that the difference in their opinions ought not to prevent
their acting in the common cause. The insurgents were repulsed in
an attack upon the town of Glasgow, which, however, Claverhouse
shortly afterwards thought it necessary to evacuate. They were now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">{99}</span>
nearly in full possession of the west of Scotland, and pitched their camp
at Hamilton, where, instead of modelling and disciplining their army,
the Cameronians and Erastians (for so the violent insurgents chose to
call the more moderate Presbyterians) only debated, in council of
war, the real cause of their being in arms. Hamilton, their general,
was the leader of the first party; Mr. John Welsh, a minister, headed
the Erastians. The latter so far prevailed as to get a declaration drawn
up, in which they owned the King’s government; but the publication
of it gave rise to new quarrels. Each faction had its own set of
leaders, all of whom aspired to be officers; and there were actually
two councils of war, issuing contrary orders and declarations, at the
same time—the one owning the King, and the other designating him a
malignant, bloody, and perjured tyrant.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, their numbers and zeal were magnified at Edinburgh,
and great alarm excited lest they should march eastward. Not only
was the foot militia instantly called out, but proclamations were issued,
directing all the heritors in the eastern, southern, and northern shires,
to repair to the King’s host, with their best horses, arms, and retainers.
In Fife, and other counties, where the Presbyterian doctrines prevailed,
many gentlemen disobeyed this order, and were afterwards severely
fined. Most of them alleged, in excuse, the apprehension of disquiet
from their wives. A respectable force was soon assembled, and James
Duke of Buccleuch and Monmouth, was sent down by Charles to take
the command, furnished with instructions not unfavourable to the
Presbyterians. The royal army now moved slowly forward towards
Hamilton, and reached Bothwell Moor on the 22nd of June, 1679.
The insurgents were encamped, chiefly in the Duke of Hamilton’s
park, along the Clyde, which separated the two armies. Bothwell
Bridge, which is long and narrow, had then a portal in the middle,
with gates, which the Covenanters shut, and barricadoed with stones
and logs of timber. This important post was defended by three
hundred of their best men, under Hackston of Rathillet and Hall of
Haughhead. Early in the morning, this party crossed the bridge and
skirmished with the royal vanguard, now advanced as far as the village
of Bothwell; but Hackston speedily retired to his post at the west end
of Bothwell Bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">{100}</span></p>

<p>“While the dispositions made by the Duke of Monmouth announced
his purpose of assailing the pass, the more moderate of the insurgents
resolved to offer terms. Ferguson of Kaitlock, a gentleman of landed
fortune, and David Hume, a clergyman, carried to the Duke of Monmouth
a supplication, demanding free exercise of their religion, a free
Parliament, and a free general assembly of the Church. The Duke
heard their demands with his natural mildness, and assured them he
would interpose with his Majesty in their behalf, on condition of their
immediately dispersing themselves, and yielding up their arms. Had
the insurgents been all of the moderate opinion, the proposal would
have been accepted, much bloodshed saved, and perhaps some permanent
advantage derived to their party; or had they been all Cameronians,
their defence would have been fierce and desperate. But, while
their motley and misassorted officers were debating upon the Duke’s
proposal, his field-pieces were already planted on the eastern side of
the river, to cover the attack of the footguards, who were led on by
Lord Livingston to force the bridge. Here Hackston maintained his
post with zeal and courage; nor was it till his ammunition was
expended, and every support denied him by the general, that he reluctantly
abandoned the important pass. When his party were drawn
back, the Duke’s army slowly, and with their cannon in front, defiled
along the bridge, and formed in line of battle as they came over the
river. The Duke commanded the foot, and Claverhouse the cavalry.
It would seem that these movements could not have been performed
without at least some loss, had the enemy been serious in opposing
them. But the insurgents were otherwise employed. With the
strangest delusion that ever fell upon devoted beings, they chose these
precious moments to cashier their officers, and elect others in their
room. In this important operation they were at length disturbed by
the Duke’s cannon, at the first discharge of which the horse of the
Covenanters wheeled and rode off, breaking and trampling down the
ranks of their infantry in their flight. The Cameronian account blames
Weir of Greenridge, a commander of the horse, who is termed a sad
Achan in the camp. The more moderate party lay the whole blame
on Hamilton, whose conduct, they say, left the world to debate
whether he was most traitor, coward, or fool. The generous Monmouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">{101}</span>
was anxious to spare the blood of his infatuated countrymen, by which
he incurred much blame among the high-flying Royalists. Lucky it
was for the insurgents that the battle did not happen a day later, when
old General Dalziel, who divided with Claverhouse the terror and
hatred of the Whigs, arrived in the camp, with a commission to
supersede Monmouth as commander-in-chief. He is said to have upbraided
the Duke publicly with his lenity, and heartily to have wished
his own commission had come a day sooner, when, as he expressed
himself, ‘these rogues should never more have troubled the King or
country.’ But, notwithstanding the merciful orders of the Duke of
Monmouth, the cavalry made great slaughter among the fugitives, of
whom four hundred were slain.</p>

<p>“There were two Gordons of Earlston, father and son. They were
descended of an ancient family in the west of Scotland, and their
progenitors were believed to have been favourers of the reformed
doctrine, and possessed of a translation of the Bible as early as the
days of Wickliffe. William Gordon, the father, was in 1663 summoned
before the privy council, for keeping Conventicles in his house and
woods. By another act of council he was banished out of Scotland;
but the sentence was never put into execution. In 1667, Earlston was
turned out of his house, which was converted into a garrison for the
King’s soldiers. He was not in the battle of Bothwell Bridge, but he
was met hastening towards it by some English dragoons engaged in the
pursuit, already commenced. As he refused to surrender, he was
instantly slain.</p>

<p>“His son, Alexander Gordon of Earlston, was not a Cameronian, but
one of the more moderate class of Presbyterians, whose sole object was
freedom of conscience and relief from the oppressive laws against Nonconformists.
He joined the insurgents shortly after the skirmish at
Loudon Hill. He appears to have been active in forwarding the
supplication sent to the Duke of Monmouth. After the battle, he
escaped discovery, by flying into a house at Hamilton, belonging to
one of his tenants, and disguising himself in a female attire. His
person was proscribed, and his estate of Earlston was bestowed upon
Colonel Theophilus Ogilthorpe by the crown, first in security for
£5000, and afterwards in perpetuity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">{102}</span></p>

<p>“The same author mentions a person tried at the circuit-court, July
10th, 1683, solely for holding intercourse with Earlston, an intercommuned
rebel. As he had been in Holland after the battle of Bothwell,
he was probably accessory to the scheme of invasion which the unfortunate
Earl of Argyll was then meditating. He was apprehended
upon his return to Scotland, tried, convicted of treason, and condemned
to die; but his fate was postponed by a letter from the King, appointing
him to be reprieved for a month, that he might, in the interim,
be tortured for the discovery of his accomplices. The council had the
unusual spirit to remonstrate against this illegal course of severity.
On November 3rd, 1683, he received a further respite, in hopes he
would make some discovery. When brought to the bar to be tortured,
(for the King had reiterated his command,) he, through fear or distraction,
roared like a bull, and laid so stoutly about him, that the
hangman and his assistant could hardly master him. At last he fell
into a swoon, and, on his recovery, charged General Dalziel and
Drummond, (violent tories,) together with the Duke of Hamilton, with
being the leaders of the fanatics. It was generally thought that he
affected this extravagant behaviour to invalidate all that agony might
extort from him concerning his real accomplices. He was sent first to
Edinburgh Castle, and afterwards to a prison upon the Bass island,
although the privy council more than once deliberated upon appointing
his immediate death. On the 22nd August, 1684, Earlston was sent
for from the Bass, and ordered for execution, 4th November, 1684.
He endeavoured to prevent his doom by escape; but was discovered
and taken after he had gained the roof of the prison. The council
deliberated, whether, in consideration of this attempt, he was not
liable to instant execution. Finally, however, they were satisfied to
imprison him in Blackness Castle, where he remained till the Revolution,
when he was set at liberty, and his doom of forfeiture reversed
by Act of Parliament.”</p>

<h3>ADDITIONAL NOTICES RELATIVE TO THE INSURRECTION OF 1679.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From “A History of the Rencontre at Drumclog,” etc.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>By William Aiton, Esq.</i></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Mr. Douglas</span> having agreed to preach at Hairlaw, or Glaisterlaw,
about a mile north-west of Loudon Hill, on Sabbath, June 1, 1679,
the Fife men and Mr. Hamilton, dreading the Conventicle might be
attacked by the military, collected a number of their friends on the
Saturday evening, in a house near Loudon Hill, where they lay under
arms all night. They also sent off an express to Lesmahagow, to
bring forward their friends from that quarter, and who were up just in
time to join in the skirmish. But very few of their friends from Kilmarnock
came forward to that Conventicle.</p>

<p>“A considerable number of people assembled at that field-meeting,
and, as usual in these times, the greater part of them came armed.
Captain Grahame of Claverhouse was, by Lord Ross, who commanded
the military in Glasgow, sent out with three troops of dragoons to
attack and disperse that Conventicle. He had seized, about two miles
from Hamilton, John King, a field-preacher, and, according to Mr.
Wilson’s account, seventeen other people, whom he bound in pairs,
and drove before him towards Loudon Hill.</p>

<p>“Captain Grahame and his officers eat their breakfast that day at
the principal inn, Strathaven, then kept by James Young, writer, innkeeper,
and baron-bailie of Avendale, known in that district by the
name of <i>Scribbie Young</i>. The house which he then occupied stood
opposite the entry into the churchyard, and, from its having an upper
room or second storey in the one end, with an outside stair of a curious
construction, was denominated ‘the tower.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Having been informed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">{104}</span>
at Strathaven that the Conventicle was not to meet that day, Captain
Grahame set out towards Glasgow with his prisoners. But, upon
obtaining more correct information about a mile north of Strathaven,
he turned round towards Loudon Hill, by the way of Letham. On
being told at Braeburn that the Covenanters were in great force, he
said that he had eleven score of good guns under his command, and
would soon disperse the Whigs.</p>

<p>“Soon after worship had commenced, the Covenanters were
informed, by an express from their friends at Hamilton, as well as by
the watches they had placed, that the military were approaching them;
and they resolved to fight the troops, in order, if possible, to relieve
the prisoners, or, to use the words of their historian, Dr. Wodrow, to
‘oppose the hellish fury of their persecutors.’ Their whole force
consisted of about 50 horsemen, ill-provided with arms, 50 footmen
with muskets, and about 150 more with halberts and forks. Mr.
Hamilton took the chief command, and David Hackston, Henry Hall,
John Balfour, Robert Fleming, William Cleland, John Loudon, and
John Brown, acted as subalterns under Mr. Hamilton. Mr. Wilson
says, ‘Hamilton gave out the word that no quarter should be given to
the enemy.’ The Covenanters did not wait the arrival of the military,
who could not have reached them but by a circuitous route; neither
did they take shelter in the mosses that lay near, and into which the
cavalry could not have followed them; but they advanced eastward
about two miles, singing psalms all the way.</p>

<p>“When Grahame reached the height at Drumclog, and saw the
Whigs about half a mile to the north of that place, near to where
Stabbyside House now stands, he placed his prisoners under a guard
in the farmyard of North Drumclog, and, having drawn up his three
troops of cavalry, he advanced to attack the Whigs. Mr. Russel
says, Claverhouse gave orders to his troops to give no quarter to the
Covenanters; and that ‘there was such a spirit given forth from the
Lord, that both men and women who had no arms faced the troops.’
The dragoons had to march down an arable field of a very slight
declivity, at the foot of which a small piece of marshy ground (provincially
termed misk or boggy land) lay between the hostile parties. As
many of the insurgents resided in that immediate neighbourhood, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">{105}</span>
could not fail to know that this marshy place, on the north side of which
they had taken their stand, was in some places too soft to support the
feet of horses. But as this swamp was covered with a sward of green
herbage, and was but of a few yards in breadth, and lying between
two fields of arable land, the declivity of which was on both sides towards
the bog, it is evident that Grahame did not perceive it to be a
marsh; and to this, above all other circumstances, is his defeat to be
attributed.</p>

<p>“This ground, so favourable to the Covenanters, appears to have
been taken up more from accident than design. If it had been their
wish to have taken their station in or behind a bog, they could have
found many of them much nearer to where the congregation first met,
and much more impenetrable to cavalry than that where the rencounter
happened. In advancing from Hairlaw Hill to the place of action,
they passed several deep flow-mosses, some of them of great extent,
and into which cavalry could not have entered. Even when the
hostile parties came in sight of each other, the Covenanters were nearer
to a flow-moss than they were to the marshy ground behind which
they placed themselves. Had Captain Grahame known the ground,
he could have easily avoided the marsh, and passed the extremity of it
by a public road, only about two or three hundred yards to the westward.</p>

<p>“The troops fired first, and, according to tradition, the Covenanters,
at the suggestion of Balfour, evaded the fire of the military by prostrating
themselves on the ground, with the exception of John Morton
in Broomhall, who, believing in the doctrine of predestination, refused
to stoop, and was shot. The ball entered his mouth, and he fell backward
at the feet of the great-grandfather of the writer of this account.
Grahame ordered the troops to charge; but a number of the horses
having, in advancing to the Covenanters, been entangled in the marsh,
the ranks were broken, and the squadron was thrown into disorder.
The Covenanters, who had no doubt foreseen what was to happen,
seized the favourable opportunity of pouring their fire on the disordered
cavalry, and, following it up with a spirited attack, soon
completed the confusion and defeat of the troops. The commander of
the Whigs cried, ‘O’er the bog, and to them, lads!’ The order was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">{106}</span>
re-echoed, and obeyed with promptitude; and, from the involved
state of the military, the forks and halberts of the Covenanters were
extremely apt to the occasion. The rout of the cavalry was instantaneous
and complete, and achieved principally by the insurgents who
were on foot, though the horsemen soon passed the bog and joined in
the pursuit. Mr. Wilson says that Balfour and Cleland were the first
persons who stepped into the bog; but the traditionary accounts allege
that it was one Woodburn, from the Mains of Loudon, who set that
example of bravery.</p>

<p>“Thus far the traditionary accounts and that of Mr. Wilson have
been followed. But Mr. Russel says that Claverhouse sent two of his
men to reconnoitre, and afterwards did so himself, before he made the
attack. If he did so, it is surprising that he did not perceive the
marsh, as well as the road by which it might have been evaded.
Russel also says that Captain Grahame sent forward twelve dragoons,
who fired at the Whigs, and that as many of them turned out and fired
at the cavalry. This, he says, was twice repeated, without a person
being hurt on either side. On their firing a third time, one dragoon
fell from his horse, and seemed to rise with difficulty. Claverhouse, he
says, then ordered thirty dragoons to dismount and fire, when William
Cleland, with twelve or sixteen armed footmen, supported by twenty or
twenty-four with halberts and forks, advanced and fired at the military.
But still no one was injured, till Cleland advanced alone, fired his
piece, and killed one dragoon; and when the Whigs were wheeling,
some of the military fired, and killed one man. Claverhouse next
advanced his whole force to the stanck, and fired desperately, ‘and the
honest party, having but few guns, was not able to stand, and being
very confused at coming off, one of the last party cried out, “For the
Lord’s sake, go on”; and immediately they ran violently forward, and
Claverhouse was tooming the shot all the time on them; but the
honest party’s right hand of the foot being nearest Cleland, went on
Clavers’s left flank, and all the body went on together against
Clavers’s body, and Cleland stood until the honest party was joined
among them both with pikes and swords, and William Dingwell and
Thomas Weir being on the right hand of the honest party, all the forenamed
who fired thrice before being together, and, louping ower, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">{107}</span>
got among the enemies. William Dingwell received his wound, his
horse being dung back by the strength of the enemy, fell over and
dang over James Russel’s horse. James presently rose and mounted
and pursued, calling to a woman to take care of his dear friend William
Dingwell, (for the women ran as fast as the men,) and she did so.
Thomas Weir rode in among them, and took a standard, and he was
mortally wounded and knocked on the head, but pursued as long as he
was able, and then fell. The honest party pursued as long as their
horses could trot, being upwards of two miles. There was of the
enemy killed thirty-six dead on the ground, and by the way in the
pursuit, and only five or six of the honest party.’</p>

<p>“Lieutenant Robert Grahame, Cornet John Arnold, and thirty-four
privates of the King’s forces were killed on the field, and several more
wounded. Five of the military were taken prisoners, and afterwards
allowed to escape. Of the Covenanters, John Morton, Thomas Weir
in Cumberhead, William Dingwell, one of the murderers of the Bishop,
James Thomson, Stonehouse, John Gabbie in Fioch, and James
Dykes in Loudon, were all mortally wounded, and died either on the
field, or soon after the skirmish.</p>

<p>“The Covenanters pursued the troops to Calder Water, about three
miles from the field of action. A person of the name of Finlay, from
Lesmahagow, armed with a pitchfork, came up with Captain Grahame,
at a place called Capernaum, near Coldwakening, and would probably
have killed that officer, had not another of the Covenanters called to
Finlay to strike at the horse, and thereby secure both it and the rider.
The blow intended for the Captain was spent upon his mare, and the
Captain escaped by mounting, with great agility, the horse of his
trumpeter, who was killed by the Whigs.</p>

<p>“The Covenanters came up with some of the dragoons near Hillhead.
The troopers offered to surrender, and asked quarter, which
some of the Covenanters were disposed to grant; but, when their
leaders came up, they actually killed these men, in spite of every
remonstrance. The men so killed were buried like felons, on the marsh
between the farms of Hillhead and Hookhead, and their graves
remained visible till the year 1750, when they were sunk in a march
dyke, drawn in that direction. The late Mr. Dykes of Fieldhead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">{108}</span>
declared to the writer of this narrative, that his grandfather, Thomas
Leiper, of Fieldhead, had often told him that he was present when
these soldiers were killed, and did what he could to save their lives,
but without effect.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p>

<p>“When the discomfited dragoons returned through Strathaven, they
were insulted and pursued by the inhabitants, down a lane called the
Hole-close, till one of the soldiers fired upon the crowd, and killed a
man, about 50 yards east from where the relief meeting-house at Strathaven
now stands.</p>

<p>“Captain Grahame retreated to Glasgow, and he is said to have
met at Cathkin some troops sent out to his aid; but he refused to
return to the charge, observing to his brother officer, that he had been
at a Whig meeting that day, but that he liked the lecture so ill that he
would not return to the afternoon’s service. Another account says,
that when Captain Grahame rode off the field, Mr. King, the preacher,
then a prisoner, called after him, by way of derision, to stop to the
afternoon’s preaching.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>“The relations of the two officers that were killed went to Drumclog
next day after the skirmish, to bury them; but the country people
had cut and mangled the bodies of the slain in such a manner that only
one of the officers could be recognised. The coffin intended for the
other was left at High Drumclog, where it remained many years in a
cart-shed, till it was used in burying a vagrant beggar that died at the
Mount, in that neighbourhood. This fact has been well attested to the
writer of this account from sources of information on which he can
rely.”</p>

  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_109.jpg" alt="W" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">e</span> shall mention a few inaccuracies in the account given of the
Porteous mob in “The Heart of Midlothian,” assigning, at the
same time, precise dates to all the incidents.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 11th of April, 1736, Wilson and Robertson
were conducted to the Tolbooth Church, for the purpose of hearing
their last sermon, their execution being to happen on Wednesday
following. The custom of conducting criminals under sentence of
death to a place of public worship, and suffering them again to mix
with their fellow-men, from whom they were so shortly to be cut off
for ever, was a beautiful trait of the devotional and merciful feelings of
the people of Scotland, which has since this incident been unhappily
disused. In the Tale, the escape of Robertson is said to have
happened after the sermon; but this statement, evidently made by the
novelist for the sake of effect, is incorrect. The criminals had scarcely
seated themselves in the pew, when Wilson committed the daring deed.
Robertson tripped up the fourth soldier himself, and jumped out of the
pew with incredible agility. In hurrying out at the door of the church,
he tumbled over the collection money, by which he was probably hurt;
for, in running across the Parliament Square, he was observed to stagger
much, and, in going down the stairs which lead to the Cowgate,
actually fell. In this dangerous predicament he was protected by Mr.
M‘Queen, minister of the New Kirk, who was coming up the stair on
his way to church at the moment. This kind-hearted gentleman is
said to have set him again on his feet, and to have covered his retreat
as much as possible from the pursuit of the guard. Robertson passed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">{110}</span>
down to the Cowgate, ran up the Horse Wynd, and out at the Potterrow
Port, the crowd all the way closing behind him, so that his pursuers
could not by any means overtake him. In the wynd he made up
to a saddled horse, and would have mounted him, but was prevented
by the owner. Passing the Crosscauseway, he got into the King’s
Park, and made the way for Duddingstone, under the basaltic rocks
which overhang the path to that village. On jumping a dyke near
Clearburn, he fainted away, but was revived by a refreshment which he
there received.</p>

<p>Upon Robertson’s escape, Wilson was immediately taken back to
prison, and put in close custody. He was executed, under the dreadful
circumstances so well known, on the 14th of April. The story of a
“young fellow, with a sailor’s cap slouched over his face,” having cut
him down from the gibbet, on the rising of the mob, is perfectly unfounded.
The executioner was at the top of the ladder, performing
that part of his office, at the time Porteous fired.</p>

<p>Though the author of the Tale has chosen George Robertson for his
hero, and invested him with many attributes worthy of that high
character, historical accuracy obliges us to record that he was merely a
stabler; and, what must at once destroy all romantic feelings concerning
him in the light of a hero, tradition informs us that he was a
married man at the time of his imprisonment. He kept an inn in
Bristo Street, and was a man of rather dissipated habits, though the
exculpatory evidence produced upon his trial represents him as in the
habit of being much intrusted by the carriers who lodged at his house.
After his escape, he was known to have gone to Holland, and to have
resided there many years.</p>

<p>The most flagrant aberration from the truth committed by the
novelist, is in the opening of the Tale, where the crowd is represented
as awaiting the execution of Captain Porteous, in the Grassmarket, on
the 7th of September. The whole scene is described in the most
admirable manner; and the interesting objects of the gallows, the filled
windows, and the crowd upon the street, form, I have no doubt, the
faithful outline of what the scene would have been, had it existed.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">{111}</span></p>
<p>But however ably the Author of “Waverley” has delineated this
imaginary scene, it is unfortunate that his account does not agree either
with truth, or, what was to him ten times more important, <i>vraisemblance</i>.
He has no doubt handled the fictitious incident of the abortive
preparations for the execution, and the expressions of the disappointed
multitude on the occasion, in his usual masterly manner, and heightened
the <i>effect</i> of his own story not a little by the use he has made of
history; but it must at the same time strike every reader that the
whole affair is extremely improbable. It seems scarcely possible that
a conspiracy of such a deep and well-planned nature as the Porteous
mob could have been laid and brought to issue in a single afternoon.
Not even the most romantic reader of novels, supposing him to understand
the case to its full extent, would deceive himself with so incredible
an absurdity; but would think with us that, according to the
natural course of things, it would take <i>all the time it did take</i>, (five
days,) before so well-laid and eventually so successful a scheme could
be projected, organized, and accomplished.</p>

<p>The plain statement of the facts is to the following effect.</p>

<p>The Queen’s pardon reached Edinburgh so early as Thursday, the
2nd of September. The riot happened on the night of Tuesday, the
7th—the night previous to the day on which the execution was to have
taken place, and after a sufficient time had elapsed for the preparation
of the scheme. Many of the rioters came from counties so distant, that
the news of the reprieve could not have reached them in a less space;
and perhaps the intelligence would not have been so speedily communicated
in those postless and coachless days, had not the popular
interest in the matter been so universal. Taking every thing into
consideration, it may indeed astonish us that the conspiracy was so
rapidly matured as it <i>was</i>, not to speak of a single afternoon! It may
be noticed, that some papers have lately come to light, by which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">{112}</span>
appears the plot was not of that dark and mysterious character which
the accounts of the times and the Author of “Waverley” make it. Information
had been given to the council at least <i>thirty-six hours</i> before
the tumult burst forth; and at a meeting late on the previous evening,
when the information was taken into consideration, the council pronounced
the reports in circulation to be merely <i>cadies’ clatters</i>, (gossip of
street-porters,) unworthy of regard.</p>

<p>The incidents of the riot, from the mob’s entering the city at the
West Port to Butler’s desertion of the scene at midnight, are all given
very correctly by the novelist. It is said to be absolutely true that the
rioters seized and detained a person of Butler’s profession, for the purpose
related in the novel. This happened, however, when they had
got half way to the gallows, at the head of the West Bow. Porteous
was twice drawn up and let down again before the deed was accomplished—first,
to bind his hands, and secondly, in order to put something
over his face. In the morning his body was found hanging, by
the public functionaries of the city, and was buried the same day in the
neighbouring churchyard of Greyfriars. It was on the south side of
the Grassmarket that he was hanged.</p>

<p>Arnot observes, after relating the incidents of the Porteous mob, in
his History of Edinburgh, that though it was then forty years after that
occurrence, no person had ever been found out upon whom an accession
to the murder could be charged. Nevertheless, the writer of the
present narrative has been informed by a very old man, who was an
apprentice in the Fleshmarket of Edinburgh about fifty years ago, that
in his younger days it was well known among the butchers, though
only whispered secretly among themselves, that the leaders of this
singular riot were two brothers of the name of Cumming, who were,
for many years after, fleshers in the Low Market, and died unmolested,
at advanced ages. They were tall, strong, and exceedingly handsome
men, had been dressed in women’s clothes on the occasion, and were
said to have been the first to jump through the flames that burnt down
the prison-door, in eagerness to seize their unfortunate victim.</p>

<p>A few more scraps of private information have also been communicated
to the world by one who was instrumental and active in the riot.
We give them from the authority of “The Beauties of Scotland.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">{113}</span></p>

<p>“On the day preceding that of Porteous’ death, a whisper went
through the country, upon what information or authority this person
knew not, that an attempt was to be made, on the succeeding evening,
to put Captain Porteous to death. To avenge the blood of a relation
who had been killed at the execution of Wilson, he conceived himself
bound in duty to share the risk of the attempt. Wherefore, upon
the following day, he proceeded to Edinburgh, and towards the evening
stopped in the suburb of Portsburgh, which he found crowded with
country people; all of whom, however, kept aloof from each other, so
that there was no conversation about the purpose of their assembling.
At a later hour, he found the inferior sort of inns in the Grassmarket
full of people, and saw many persons, apparently strangers, lurking in
the different houses. About eleven at night, the streets became
crowded with men, who, having in some measure organized their body,
by beating a drum and marching in order, immediately proceeded to
secure the gates and make for the prison.”</p>

<p>“As the multitude proceeded with Porteous down the West Bow,
some of their number knocked at the door of a shop and demanded
ropes.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> A woman, apparently a maid-servant, thrust a coil of ropes
out of a window, without opening the door, and a person wearing a
white apron, which seemed to be assumed for disguise, gave in return
a piece of gold as the price,” etc.</p>


<h3>THE CITY GUARD.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> City Guard, of which so much mention is made in the Tale before
us, was originally instituted in 1648. Previous to that period, the City
had been watched during the night by the personal duty of the
inhabitants, a certain number of whom were obliged to undertake
the office by rotation. In order to relieve the inconveniency of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">{114}</span>
service, a body of sixty men was first appointed, with a captain, two
lieutenants, two sergeants, and three corporals; but no regular funds
being provided for the support of the establishment, it was speedily
dissolved. However, about thirty years thereafter, the necessity of a
regular police was again felt; and forty men were raised. These, in
the year 1682, were augmented, at the instigation of the Duke of York,
to 108 men; and, to defray the expense of the company, a tax was
imposed upon the citizens. At the Revolution, the Town Council
represented to the Estates of Parliament, that the burden was a
grievance to the City; and their request to have it removed was
granted. So speedily, however, did they repent this second dismissal
of their police, that the very next year they applied to Parliament for
authority to raise a body of no fewer than 126 men, and to assess the
inhabitants for the expense. Since that period the number of the
Town Guard had been very fluctuating, and, before its late final dissolution,
amounted only to about 75 men. For many years previous to
this event, they had been found quite inadequate to the protection of
the City. Riots seemed to be in some measure encouraged by the
ridicule in which the venerable corps was held; and from their
infirmities and other circumstances, as well as from their scantiness, the
more distant parts of the rapidly increasing capital were left defenceless
and open to the attacks of nightly depredators. Their language, their
manners, and their tempers, so uncongenial with those of the citizens
whom they protected, were also found to be almost inapplicable to the
purposes for which they served, and, of course, operated as causes of
their being disbanded. Besides, a few years before their dismissal, a
regular police, similar to that of London, had been established in
Edinburgh; which soon completely set aside all necessity of their
services. The Town Guard were therefore convoked for the last time,
we believe, in February, 1817; and, after receiving some small gratuity
from the magistrates, and having a pension settled upon them still more
trifling than their trifling pay, proportioned to the rank they held in
the corps, were finally disbanded. The police of Edinburgh is now
almost unrivalled in Britain for vigilance and activity—how different
from the unruly and intemperate times when magisterial authority
could be successfully set at defiance, when mobs could unite into such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">{115}</span>
a system of co-operation as even to beard royalty itself, when (in 1812)
a scene of violence could be exhibited that would not have disgraced
the middle ages, and when, still more to be lamented, the protection of
property was so uncertain, that, according to the city-arms, it was but
too literally true that—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Unless the <i>Lord</i> the City kept,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The <i>watchmen</i> watched in vain!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another event occurred about the same time in Edinburgh, which
was appropriately contemporaneous with the abolition of the City
Guard,—namely, the demolishment and final removal of the Tolbooth.
This building, which makes so conspicuous a figure in the present Tale,
was originally the Town-house of Edinburgh, and afterwards afforded
accommodation for the Scottish Parliament and Courts of Justice, and
for the confinement of debtors and malefactors. It had been used
solely as a jail since 1640. It was not deficient in other interesting
recollections, besides being the scene of the Porteous mob. Here
Queen Mary delivered, what are termed by John Knox her <i>Painted
Orations</i>; and on its dreary summits had been successively displayed
the heads of a Morton, a Gowrie, a Huntly, a Montrose, and an
Argyll,—besides those of many of inferior note.</p>

<p>A part of this edifice had been devoted to the use of the City Guard,
ever since the removal of their former rendezvous in the High Street.
Many will still remember of seeing a veteran or two leaning over a
half-door in the north side of the Jail. Could their eyes have penetrated
farther into the gloomy interior, a few more indistinct figures
might have been perceived smoking round a fire, or reading an old
newspaper, while the unintelligible language which they spoke might
aid the idea of their resemblance to a convocation of infernals in some
of the cinder-holes of Tartarus. In fine weather, a few of the venerable
corps might be seen crawling about the south front of the prison, with
Lochaber axes over their shoulders, or reposing lazily on a form with
the white-haired keeper of the Tolbooth door, and basking in the sun,
in all the lubber luxury of mental and corporeal abandonment. But
now (<i>sic transit gloria mundi!</i>) their ancient Capitol is levelled with
the dust, and they themselves are only to be ranked among the “things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">{116}</span>
that were.” All trace of their existence is dispersed over a waste of
visioned recollection; and future generations will think of the City
Guard, as they think of <i>the forty-five</i>, of <i>the Friends of the People</i>,—or
of the last year’s snow!</p>

<p>It is said, in the “Heart of Midlothian,” that “a phantom of former
days,” in the shape of “an old worn-out Highlander, dressed in a
cocked hat, bound with white tape instead of silver lace, and in coat,
waistcoat and breeches, of a muddy-coloured red,” (the costume of <i>the
Guard</i>,) “still creeps around the statue of Charles the Second, in the
Parliament Square, as if the image of a Stuart were the last refuge
for any memorial of our ancient manners.” This venerable spectre
is neither more nor less than the goodly flesh and blood figure of John
Kennedy, who served in the corps ever since the American war, and
who is now employed by Mr. Rae, keeper of the Parliament House,
to sweep the arcade, and to prevent little ragged urchins from disturbing
by their noisy sports the weightier business of the law. John
Kennedy was one of the band; and was well known to the heroes of
the High School forty years ago. Like him, the greater part of his
surviving brethren have changed into new shapes. One or two may
be observed now and then, staggering about the outskirts of the town,
or dozing away the last years of life upon the seats in the Meadow
Walk and the King’s Park. Their old musty coats, in such instances,
are dyed in some colour less military than red, and generally otherwise
modernized by abscission of the skirts. A pair of their original spatterdashers
still case their legs,—but which still less scarcely fend than
formerly</p>

<p>We once stumbled upon a veteran snugly bedded in a stall of about
three feet square, crammed into the internal space of an outside stair
in the West Bow. In this den he exercised the calling of a cobbler.
Like all shoemakers, he was an earnest politician, and read the
<i>Scotsman</i> every week in the second month of its age, after it had made
the tour of <i>the Bow</i>;—“being determined,” he said, “to <i>stick by the
nation</i>!” We have also sometimes found occasion to recognise the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">{117}</span>
nose of an old acquaintance, under the disguise of a circulator of bills,
at the doors of certain haberdashers on the South Bridge. We have
a peculiar veneration for a puff given forth from the paw of an <i>old
Town-Guardsman</i>; and seldom find it in our heart to put such a
document to a death of candle-ends.</p>

<p>One of the principal reasons which David Deans assigned to Saddletree,
for not employing counsel in the cause of his daughter Effie, was
the notorious Jacobitism of the faculty, who, he said, had received
into their library the medals which that Moabitish woman, the
Duchess of Gordon, had sent to them. This was a true and, moreover,
a curious case. In 1711, the great-grandmother of the present
Duke of Gordon excited no small attention by presenting to the
Faculty of Advocates a silver medal, with a head of the Pretender on
one side, and, on the other, the British isles, with the word <i>Reddite</i>.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
The Dean having presented the medal to the faculty at the next
meeting, a debate ensued about the propriety of admitting it into their
repositories. It was carried 63 to 12 to admit the medal, and return
thanks to the duchess for her present. Two advocates, delegated for
that purpose, waited upon her grace, and expressed their hopes that
she would soon have an opportunity of complimenting the faculty with
a second medal on the <i>Restoration</i>.</p>

<p>This lady was the wife of George, first Duke of Gordon, who held
out Edinburgh Castle for King James, in 1689.</p>


<h3>JEANIE DEANS.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> plot of this tale, besides bearing some resemblance to that of
The Exiles of Siberia, finds a counterpart in the story of Helen Walker.</p>

<p>When the following account of this person was taken down, in
1786, she was a little stout-looking woman, between 70 and 80 years
of age, dressed in a long tartan plaid, and having over her white cap,
(<i>Scottice</i>, <span class="allsmcap">TOY</span>,) a black silk hood tied under her chin. She lived in
the neighbourhood of Dumfries, on the romantic banks of the immortalized
Clouden, a little way above the bridge by which the road<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">{118}</span>
from Dumfries to Sanquhar crosses that beautiful stream. She lived
by the humblest means of subsistence,—working stockings, teaching
a few children, and rearing now and then a small brood of chickens.
Her countenance was remarkably lively and intelligent, her eyes were
dark and expressive, and her conversation was marked by a naïveté
and good sense that seemed to fit her for a higher sphere in life.
When any question was asked concerning her earlier life, her face
became clouded, and she generally contrived to turn the conversation
to a different topic.</p>

<p>Her story, so far as it was ever known, bore that she had been early
left an orphan, with the charge of a younger sister, named <i>Tibby</i>,
(Isabella,) whom she endeavoured to maintain and educate by her
own exertions. It will not be easy to conceive her feelings when her
sister was apprehended on a charge of child-murder, and herself called
on as a principal witness against her. The counsel for the prisoner
told Helen, that if she could declare that her sister had made any
preparation, however slight, or had communicated any notice of her
situation, such a statement would save her sister’s life. But, from the
very first, this high-souled woman determined against such a perjury,
and avowed her resolution to give evidence according to her conscience.
Isabella was of course found guilty and condemned; and, in removing
her from the bar, she was heard to say to her sister, “Oh, Nelly!
ye’ve been the cause of my death!”</p>

<p>Helen Walker, however, was as remarkable for her dauntless
perseverance in a good cause as for her fortitude in resisting the temptations
of a bad one. She immediately procured a petition to be
drawn up, stating the peculiar circumstances of the case, and that very
night of her sister’s condemnation set out from Dumfries for London.
She travelled on foot, and was neither possessed of introduction nor
recommendation. She presented herself in her tartan plaid and
country attire before John Duke of Argyll, after having watched three
days at his door, just as he was stepping into his carriage, and
delivered her petition. Herself and her story interested him so much,
that he immediately procured the pardon she solicited, which was
forwarded to Dumfries, and Helen returned on foot, having performed
her meritorious journey in the course of a few weeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">{119}</span></p>

<p>After her liberation, Isabella was married to the father of her child,
and retired to some distance in the north of England, where Helen
used occasionally to visit her.</p>

<p>Helen Walker, whom every one will be ready to acknowledge as
the <i>Original</i> of Jeanie Deans, died in the spring of 1787; and her
remains lie in the Churchyard of Irongray, without a stone to mark
the place where they are deposited.</p>


<h3>PATRICK WALKER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> objurgatory exhortation which David Deans delivers to his
daughters, on suddenly overhearing the word “<i>dance</i>” pronounced in
their conversation, will be remembered by our readers. He there
“blesses God, (with that singular worthy, Patrick Walker the packman
at Bristo-port,) that ordered his lot in his dancing days, so that
fear of his head and throat, cauld and hunger, wetness and weariness,
stopped the lightness of his head and the wantonness of his feet.”
Almost the whole of David’s speech is to be found at the 59th page
of Patrick Walker’s “Life of Cameron,” with much more curious
matter.</p>

<p>This “Patrick Walker” was a person who had suffered for the good
cause in his youth, along with many others of the “singular worthies”
of the times. After the Revolution, it appears that he exercised the
profession of a pedlar. He probably dealed much in those pamphlets
concerning the sufferings and the doctrines of the “<i>Martyrs</i>,” which
were so widely diffused throughout Scotland, in the years subsequent
to the Revolution. In the process of time he set up his staff of rest
in a small shop at the head of Bristo Street, opposite to the entrance
of a court entitled “Society.” Here Patrick flourished about a century
ago, and published several works, now very scarce and curious, of
“Remarkable Passages in the Lives and Deaths of those famous
worthies, signal for piety and zeal, <i>viz.</i> Mr. John Semple, Mr. Wellwood,
Mr. Cameron, Mr. Peden, etc.; who were all shining lights in
the Land, and gave light to many, in which they rejoiced for a season.”
For this sort of biography Patrick seems to have been excellently
adapted; for he had not only been witness to many of the incidents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">{120}</span>
which he describes, but, from his intimate personal friendship with the
subjects of his narratives, he was also a complete adept in all their
intricate polemics and narrow superstitions. These he accordingly
gives in such a style of length, strength, and volubility, as leaves us
weltering in astonishment at the extensive range of expression of which
Cant was susceptible. Take the following, for instance, from the
rhapsodies of Peden. “A bloody sword, a bloody sword, a bloody
sword for thee, O Scotland! Many miles shall ye travel and shall see
nothing but desolation and ruinous wastes in thee, O Scotland! The
fertilest places shall be desert as the mountains in thee, O Scotland! Oh
the Monzies, the Monzies, see how they run! how long will they run?
Lord, cut their houghs and stay their running. The women with child
shall be ript up and dashed in pieces. Many a preaching has God
waired (<i>spent</i>) on thee, O Scotland! But now He will come forth with
the fiery brand of His wrath, and then He will preach to thee by conflagration,
since words winna do! O Lord, Thou hast been baith good
and kind to auld Sandy, thorow a long tract of time, and given him
many years in Thy Service which have been but like as many months.
But now he is tired of the warld, and sae let him away with the honesty
he has, for he will gather no more!” We will also extract Patrick’s
own account of an incident which is related upon his authority in the
“Heart of Midlothian,” at the 54th page of the second volume. It is
a good specimen of his style:—</p>

<p>“One time, among many, he<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> designed to administrate the Sacrament
of the Lord’s Supper; and before the time cam, he assured the
people that the devil would be envious of the good work they were to
go about,—that he was afraid he would be permitted to raise a storm
in the air with a speat of rain, to raise the water, designing to drown
some of them; but it will not be within the compass of his power to
drown any of you, no not so much as a dog. Accordingly it came to
pass, on <i>Monday</i>, when they were dismissing, they saw a man all in
black, entering the water to wade, a little above them; they were
afraid, the water being big; immediately he lost his feet, (as they
apprehended,) and came down lying on his back, and waving his hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">{121}</span>
The people ran and got ropes, and threw in to him; and tho’ there
were ten or twelve men upon the ropes, they were in danger of being
drowned into the water: Mr. Semple, looking on, cryed, ‘Quit the ropes
and let him go, (he saw who it was,) ’tis the devil, ’tis the devil; he
will burn, but not drown; and, by drowning you, would have God
dishonoured, because He hath gotten some glory to His free grace, in
being kind to mony of your souls at this time. Oh! he is a subtile
wylie devil, that lies at the catch, waiting his opportunity, that now,
when ye have heard all ye will get at this occasion, his design is to
raise a confusion among you, to get all out of your minds that ye have
heard, and off your spirits that ye have felt.’ He earnestly exhorted
them all to keep in mind what they had heard and seen, and to retain
what they had attained, and to go home blessing God for all, and that
the devil was disappointed of his hellish design. All search was made
in the country, to find out if any man was lost, but none could be heard
of; from whence all concluded that it was the devil.”</p>

<p>According to Patrick, this same Mr. Semple was remarkable for
much discernment and sagacity, besides that which was necessary for
the detection of devils. From the following “passage,” the reader
will observe that he was equally acute in the detection of witches.
“While a neighbouring minister was distributing tokens before the
sacrament, Mr. Semple standing by, and seeing him reaching a token
to a woman, said, ‘Hold your hand; that Woman hath got too many
tokens already, for she is a witch;’ of which none suspected her then:
yet afterwards she confessed herself to be a witch, and was put to death
for the same.”</p>

<p>We also find John Semple, of Carsphearn, introduced into that well-known
irreverent work, “Scots Presbyterian Eloquence”; where an
humorous burlesque of his style of expression is given in the following
words: “In the day of judgment the Lord will say, ‘Who’s that
there?’ John will answer, ‘It’s e’en poor auld John Semple, Lord.’
‘Who are these with you, John?’ ‘It’s a few poor honest bonneted
men.’ ‘Strange, John! where’s all your folks with their hats and
silk hoods?’ ‘I invited them, Lord; but they would not come.’ ‘It’s
not your fault, John; come forward, ye are very welcome, and these
few with you!’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">{122}</span></p>

<p>In the <i>reekit</i> and mutilated volume of “Lives” before us, we have
found a considerable number of passages which are alluded to in the
narratives of My Landlord—more indeed than it would be interesting
to point out. The use which the Author makes of the information he
derives from them is by no means dishonourable, except perhaps in
one instance, vol. iv., page 134, where it must be allowed he is rather
waggish upon Patrick, besides corrupting the truth of his text. This
instance relates to the murder of a trooper named Francis Gordon, said
to have been committed by the Cameronians. Patrick denies the
charge of murder, and calls it only killing in self-defence. His own
account is as follows: “It was then commonly said, that Mr. Francis
Gordon was a Volunteer out of Wickedness of Principles, and could
not stay with the Troops, but must alwaies be raging and ranging to
catch hiding suffering people. Meldrum and Airly’s Troops, lying at
Lanark upon the first Day of March, 1682, Mr. Gordon and another
Comrade, with their two Servants and four Horses, came to Kilcaigow,
two Miles from Lanark, searching for William Caigow and others
under Hiding. Mr. Gordon, rambling thorow the Town, offered to
abuse the women. At night they came a mile further to the Easterseat,
to Robert Muir’s, he being also under hiding. Gordon’s comrade
and the two servants went to bed, but he could sleep none, roaring all
the night for women. When day came, he took his sword in his hand,
and came to Moss-Platt; and some men, (who had been in the fields
all night,) seeing him, they fled, and he pursued. James Wilson,
Thomas Young, and myself, having been in a meeting all night, were
lying down in the morning. We were alarmed, thinking there were
many more than one. He pursued hard and overtook us. Thomas
Young said, ‘Sir, what do you pursue us for?’ He said, he was
come to send us to Hell. James Wilson said, ‘That shall not be, for
we will defend ourselves.’ He answered that either he or we should
go to it now, and then ran his sword furiously thorow James Wilson’s
coat. James fired upon him, but missed him. All the time he cried,
‘damn his soul!’ He got a shot in his head out of a pocket pistol,
rather fit for diverting a boy than for killing such a furious, mad, brisk
man; which notwithstanding killed him dead.” Patrick does not
mention who it was that shot him; and from his obscurity on this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">{123}</span>
point, we are led to suspect that it was no other than himself; for had
it been Thomas Young, it is probable that he would have mentioned it.
In the ‘Tale,’ David Deans is mentioned as being among them, and
half confesses to the merit of having killed Mr. Gordon; but our
venerable biographer is also made to prefer a sort of a half claim to
the honour, while neither of them dared utterly to avow it; ‘there
being some wild cousins of the deceased about Edinburgh who might
have been yet addicted to revenge.’”</p>

<p>The “worthy John Livingston, a sailor in Borrowstownness,” who
is quoted for a saying at the 37th page of the fourth volume, will be
found at 107th page of Patrick’s “Life of Cameron,” with the words
ascribed to him at full length. Borrowstownness seems to have been
a somewhat holy place in its day; for, besides this worthy, we learn
from the same authority that it also produced “Skipper William Horn,
that singular, solid, serious, old exercised, self-denied, experienced,
confirmed, established, tender Christian,” and another tar of the name
of Alexander Stewart, who “suffered at the Cross” for a cause in
which few of his profession have ever since thought of suffering,—together
with two other worthies named Cuthel, one of whom was
beheaded along with Mr. Cargill.</p>

<p>At the 40th page of the same fourth volume, David Deans declares
himself to have been the person “of whom there was some sport at
the Revolution, when he noited thegither the heads of the twa false
prophets, their ungracious Graces the Prelates, as they stood on the
High Street, after being expelled from the Convention-parliament.”
The source of this story is also to be found in the works of Patrick
Walker. This sage historian relates the circumstance in a manner
rather too facetious to be altogether consistent with his habitual gravity.
“Fourteen Bishops,” says he, “were expelled at once, and stood in
a cloud, with pale faces, in the Parliament Close. James Wilson,
Robert Neilson, Francis Hislop, and myself, were standing close by
them. Francis Hislop, with force, thrust Robert Neilson upon them,
and their heads went hard upon each other. Their graceless Graces
went quickly off; and in a short time neither Bishop nor Curate were
to be seen in the streets. This was a sudden and surprising change,
not to be forgotten. But some of us would have rejoiced still more to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">{124}</span>
have seen the whole cabalzie sent legally down the Bow, that they
might have found the weight of their tails in a tow, to dry their
stocking-soles, and let them know what hanging was.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>


<h3>PARTICULARS REGARDING SCENERY, ETC.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Saint Leonard’s Crags</span>, the scene of David Deans’s residence, are
an irregular ridge, with a slight vegetation, situated in the south-west
boundary of the King’s Park, at Edinburgh. Adjacent to them, and
bearing their name, there exists a sort of village, now almost inclosed
by the approaching suburbs of the city. The neighbouring extremity
of the Pleasance, with this little place, seem to have formed at one
period the summer residences or villas of the inhabitants of Edinburgh,
some of the houses even yet bearing traces of little garden plots before
the door, and other peculiarities of what is still the prevailing taste in
the fitting up of <i>boxes</i>. None of these may, however, have existed in
the time of David Deans. In former times, St. Leonard’s Crags and
the adjoining valley used to be much resorted to by duellists. This
part of their history is, however, to be found at full length in the
“Heart of Midlothian.” There is a case of duel on record, in which
a barber challenged a citizen, and fought him with swords. It happened
in the year 1600. The citizen was slain; and his antagonist,
being instantly apprehended, was tried, and, by the order of the King,
executed, for having presumed to take the revenge of a gentleman.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">{125}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Muschat’s Cairn</span>, so conspicuously introduced into this Tale, was
a heap of stones placed upon the spot where a barbarous murder was
committed in the year 1720. The murderer was descended of a
respectable family in the county of Angus, and had been educated to
the profession of a surgeon. When in Edinburgh, in the course of his
education, it appears that he made an imprudent match with a woman
in humble life, named Margaret Hall. He shortly repented of what
he had done, and endeavoured by every means to shake himself free of
his wife. The attempts which he made to divorce, to forsake, and to
poison her, proved all unsuccessful; till at length he resolved, in the
distraction caused by his frequent disappointments, to rid himself of
his incumbrance by the surest method, that of cutting her throat. The
day before the perpetration of this deed, he pretended a return of
affection to the unfortunate woman, and in the evening took her to
walk with him, in the direction of Duddingston. The unhappy
creature was averse to the expedition, and intreated her husband to
remain in Edinburgh; but he persisted, in spite of her tears, in his
desire of taking her with him to that village. When they had got
nearly to the extremity of the path which is called the Duke’s Walk,
(having been the favourite promenade of the Duke of York, afterwards
King James II.,) Muschat threw her upon the ground, and immediately
proceeded to cut her throat. During her resistance he wounded her
hand and chin, which she held down, endeavouring to intercept the
knife; and he declared in his confession, afterwards taken, that, but
for her long hair, with which he pinned her to the earth, he could not
have succeeded in his purpose, her struggles being so great. Immediately
after the murder, he went and informed some of his
accomplices, and took no pains to evade apprehension. He was tried
and found guilty upon his own confession, and, after being executed
in the Grassmarket, was hung in chains upon the Gallowlee.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> A cairn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">{126}</span>
of stones was erected upon the spot where the murder took place, in
token of the people’s abhorrence and reprobation of the deed. It was
removed several years since, when the Duke’s Walk was widened and
levelled by Lord Adam Gordon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Anthony’s Chapel</span>, among the ruins of which Robertson
found means to elude the pursuit of Sharpitlaw, is an interesting relic
of antiquity, situated on a level space about half-way up the north-west
side of the mountain called Arthur’s Seat. It lies in a westerly direction
from Muschat’s Cairn, at about the distance of a furlong; and the
Hunter’s Bog, also mentioned in this Tale, occupies a valley which
surrounds all that side of the hill. The chapel was originally a place
of worship, annexed to a hermitage at the distance of a few yards, and
both were subservient to a monastery of the same name, which
anciently flourished on the site of St. Anthony’s Street in Leith. In
the times of Maitland and Arnot the ruin was almost entire; but now
there only remain a broken wall and a few fragments of what has once
been building, but which are now scarcely to be distinguished from the
surrounding grey rocks;—so entirely has art in this case relapsed into
its primitive nature, and lost all the characteristics of human handiwork.
The slightest possible traces of a hermitage are also to be
observed, plastered against the side of a hollow rock; and, further
down the hill, there springs from the foot of a precipice the celebrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">{127}</span>
St. Anthony’s Well. Queen Mary is said to have visited all
these scenes; and, somehow or other, her name is always associated
with them by those who are accustomed to visit, on a Sunday afternoon,
their hallowed precincts. They are also rendered sacred in
song, by their introduction into one of the most beautiful, most
plaintive, and most poetical of all Scotland’s ancient melodies:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“I leant my back unto an aik,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">I thought it was a trusty tree:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But first it bowed and syne it brak,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sae my true love’s forsaken me.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Oh! Arthur’s Seat shall be my bed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">The sheets shall ne’er be pressed by me:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">St. Anton’s well shall be my drink,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Sin’ my true love’s forsaken me,” etc.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The situation is remarkably well adapted for a hermitage, though
in the immediate neighbourhood of a populous capital. The scene
around is as wild as a Highland desert, and gives an air of seclusion
and peacefulness as complete. If the distant din of the city at all
could reach the eremite’s ears, it would appear as insignificant as the
murmur of the waves around the base of the isolated rock, and would
be as unheeded.</p>

</div><p><span class="uppercase">ohn Hamilton</span>, second son of Sir Walter Hambledon of
Cadzow, ancestor of the Dukes of Hamilton, married the heiress of
Innerwick,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> in East Lothian, in the reign of King Robert Bruce, and
was the progenitor of “a race of powerful barons,” who flourished for
about three hundred years, and “intermarried with the Douglasses,
Homes,” etc. They possessed a great many lands on the coast of
East Lothian, betwixt Dunbar and the borders of Berwickshire, and
also about Dirleton and North Berwick. They had their residence at
the Castle of Innerwick, now in ruins. Wolff’s Crag is supposed to
be the Castle of Dunglas; and this supposition is strengthened by the
retour<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of a person of the name of Wolff, in the year 1647, of some
parts of the Barony of Innerwick, being on record, and the castle
having been blown up by gunpowder in 1640, a circumstance slightly
noticed in the Tale, but too obvious to be mistaken.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Of this family
the Earls of Haddington are descended. They began to decline about
the beginning of the 17th century, when they seem to have lost the title
of Innerwick<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and began to take their designation from other parts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">{129}</span>
the family inheritance, such as Fenton, Lawfield, etc. The last of
them was a Colonel Alexander Hamilton, who was in life in 1670, and
had been <i>abroad</i> for some time—thus agreeing with the Story in one
particular which had a material influence on the fortunes of the family.
In him the direct male line became extinct, and, according to the
prophecy, his name was “lost for evermore.” The circumstances of
this family, and the period of their decline, agree so exactly with the
Tale, that, unless the <i>local</i> scene of it be altogether a fiction, it appears,
at first view, scarcely possible to doubt that the Lords of Ravenswood
and the Hamiltons of Innerwick were the same.</p>

<p>Taking this supposition to be correct, a conjecture might be
hazarded, in the absence of any authentic information on the subject,
from the present possessors of the domains of the family of Innerwick,
who Sir William Ashton was. Sir John Nisbet of Dirleton was Lord
Advocate in the reign of King Charles II., and afterwards a Lord of
Session, at the very time when Colonel Hamilton above mentioned
was abroad. He seems to have been the founder of his family; and
in this respect, as well as his having been a great lawyer, bears a
remarkable resemblance to Sir William Ashton. He died without
male issue, (another coincidence,) and in possession of the very estate
which belonged to the Hamiltons of Innerwick, which his posterity
still enjoy. From the want, however, of written memoirs of the
family at Dirleton, or a knowledge of the manner in which they
acquired their estates, any conjecture which can be founded on these
circumstances must be entirely hypothetical.</p>

<p>Though silent regarding the house of Ravenswood, the subject of
the story has received considerable elucidation from a note<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> annexed
to the Review of it in the <i>Edinburgh Monthly Review</i> for August,
1819, wherein it is stated, that Lucy Ashton was one of the daughters
of the first Lord Stair. This nobleman was certainly the only lawyer
at that period who enjoyed the power and influence said to have been
possessed by Sir William Ashton; and the circumstances mentioned
in the above note, as related in Mr. Kirkpatrick Sharpe’s edition of
“Law’s Memorialls,” particularly the expression made use of by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">{130}</span>
bride, of “Take up your bonnie bridegroom,” may, if well authenticated,
be considered as decisive of the question. It is difficult, however,
to trace any connection between Lord Stair and the family of Innerwick,
or that he ever was in possession of their property. In this
view of the case, the parallel between Ravenswood and Hamilton of
Innerwick does not hold so well. But if the identity of Sir William
Ashton with Lord Stair be considered as established, there was another
family in more immediate contact with him, in the history of which
there are several events which seem to indicate that the Author had
it in his eye in the representation he has given of the Ravenswoods;
unless, as is very probable, he has blended the history of both together
in the manner that best suited his purpose. He indeed admits that he
has disguised facts and incidents, for the obvious purpose of making
the application less pointed to the real personages of the tale. The
family here alluded to is that of Gordon, Viscount Kenmure, in
Galloway, between which and the Lords of Ravenswood there are
several points of resemblance. For instance, the barony of Gordon,
in Berwickshire, where the Gordons had their first settlement in
Scotland, and which continued for a long time in this branch of the
name, is in the immediate vicinity of Lammermoor, and probably
suggested the idea of laying the scene in that neighbourhood. The
names of the Castle (or Barony) and of the Barons themselves, were
the same. Their history was “interwoven with that of the kingdom
itself,” a well-known fact. The Viscount of Kenmure<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> was engaged
in the civil wars in the reign of King Charles I.,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> and was forfeited by
Cromwell for his steady adherence to that monarch. In him also the
direct line of the family suffered an interruption, the title having at his
death devolved on Gordon of Penninghame, who appears to have
been much involved in debt, and harassed with judicial proceedings
against his estate. This latter again espoused the sinking side in the
Revolution of 1688, and commanded a regiment at the battle of
Killiecrankie. These coincidences are too remarkable to be overlooked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">{131}</span>
And it may be added, in further illustration, that Lord Stair, on being
advanced to an earldom about this period, took one of his titles from
the barony of Glenluce, which once belonged to a branch of the house
of Kenmure.</p>

<p>It was formerly mentioned, that the Author admits his having disguised
dates and events, in order to take off the application to the
real personages of the story, which they must otherwise have pointed
out. Of this sort are several anachronisms which appear in the work,
such as a <i>Marquis</i> of A. (evidently Athol, from the letter to Ravenswood
dated at B. or Blair), when the Tory Ministry of Queen Anne
got into power, which was only in 1710, when M. Harley succeeded
Lord Godolphin as Treasurer; whereas the nobleman here alluded to
was a <i>Duke</i> so far back as 1703. The time at which the events really
took place must also have been long prior to this period, for Lord
Stair died in 1695; and the change in administration by which Sir
William Ashton lost his influence probably refers to Lord Stair’s
removal from his office in 1682.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked, that the family of Stair was by no means
so obscure and insignificant as that of Sir William Ashton is represented
to have been. They possessed the barony of Dalrymple<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> in
the reign of King Alexander III.; they acquired the barony of Stair
by marriage in 1450. They made a considerable figure during the
reign of Queen Mary; and took an active part in the Reformation
along with the confederate lords who had associated in defence of the
Protestant religion. It must be admitted, however, that they made
a greater figure at this time, and during a subsequent period, than
they ever did before.</p>

</div>

<p>“The reader will probably feel the interest of this affecting story
considerably increased, by his being informed that it is founded on
facts. The particulars, which have been variously reported, are given
in a foot-note to Mr. Sharpe’s edition of ‘Law’s Memorialls,’ p. 226;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">{132}</span>
but are understood to have been sometimes told in conversation by the
celebrated Poet to whom public opinion assigns these Tales. The
ingenious author, whoever he is, has adopted that account of the circumstances
which Mr. Sharpe deems less probable. The prototype
of Lucy Ashton was one of the daughters of James, first Lord Stair,
by his wife Margaret, daughter of Ross of Balneil, County of Wigton,
a lady long reputed a witch by the country people in her neighbourhood,
and considered as the cause, <i>per fas et nefas</i>, of the prosperous
fortunes of the Dalrymple family. However this may have been, there
was also ascribed to her supposed league with Satan, or her extreme
obduracy, the miserable catastrophe now alluded to. The first version
of the story in Mr. Sharpe’s note decidedly and directly implicates
the old lady and her potent ally in the murder of her daughter on the
night of her marriage, which had been contracted against the mother’s
will; and, according to this account, it is the bridegroom who is found
in the chimney in a state of idiocy. The other edition, which is that
of the Tale, seems to require nothing beyond the agency of human
passions wrought up to derangement. According to it, the young
lady, as in the case of Lucy, was compelled to marry contrary to her
inclination, her heart having been previously engaged elsewhere.
After she had retired with her husband into the nuptial chamber, and
the door, as was customary, had been locked, she attacked him
furiously with a knife, and wounded him severely, before any assistance
could be rendered. When the door was broken open, the youth was
found half dead upon the floor, and his wife in a state of the wildest
madness, exclaiming, ‘Take up your bonnie bridegroom.’ It is
added, that she never regained her senses; and that her husband, who
recovered of his wound, would bear no questions on the subject of his
marriage, taking even a hint of that nature as a mortal affront to his
honour. The coincidence of circumstances, and the identity of expression
used by the bride, are much too striking to be purely
accidental, and altogether deserved to be noticed, though at the hazard
of making a long note. Lady Stair, it may not be irrelevant to state,
was conspicuous in her time for what Mr. Sharpe denominates, ‘her
violent turn towards Conventicles, and the fostering of silenced
preachers in her house,’—peculiarities quite of a piece with the attachments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">{133}</span>
and habits of Lady Ashton. Of the prejudices and malignity
of her enemies, we may form some opinion from the satiric lines upon
her long-wished-for and timely death, which Mr. Sharpe very justly
denominates most unchristian. Let the <i>epitaph</i> contrived for her bear
testimony:—</p>

<h3>LUCY ASHTON AND BUCKLAW.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> derive the following curious notices respecting the Lucy Ashton
and Bucklaw of real life, from a rare volume, entitled “Tripatriarchicon;
or, the Lives of the Three Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob. Digested into English Verse, by Mr. Andrew Symson, M.A.,
late Minister of Kinkinner. Edinburgh: Printed for the Author.
1705.” The following Poem is one of thirteen elegies found appended
to some rare copies of the book, which were withdrawn from the
greater part of the edition, on account of the offence taken against them
by the Whigs. Symson seems to have been a sincere and zealous
partizan of High Church, and does not seem to have permitted any
great man of his own party to die without an appropriate elegy,
accompanied by a cutting tirade upon his enemies.</p>

<p>One of these curious pieces is “A Funeral Elegie occasioned by the
sad and much lamented Death of that worthily respected and very
much accomplished Gentleman, David Dunbar, Younger of Baldone.
He departed this life on March 21, 1682, having received a bruise by
a fall, as he was ryding the day preceding betwixt Leith and Holyroodhouse;
and was honourably interred, in the Abbey Church of
Holyroodhouse, on April 4, 1682.” Symson, though a printer in
1705, had been an episcopal clergyman: and it is amusing to observe
how much of the panegyric which he bestows upon Dunbar is to be
traced to the circumstance of that gentleman having been almost his
only hearer, when, in a Whiggish parish, his curacy had like to be a
perfect sinecure, so far as regarded that important particular—a congregation.
He thus speaks of him:—</p>

<h3>A COUNTRY INNKEEPER.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Caleb Balderston.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> prototype of Caleb Balderstone was perhaps <i>Laird Bour</i>, a
servant of the Logans of Restalrig, in 1600. It is evident that the
<i>character</i> is just a Scottish edition of “Garrick’s Lying Valet.” We
have discovered, however, a solitary trait of Caleb, in a Scotch innkeeper
of real existence, who lived long in the south country,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and died
only a few years ago. We subjoin a very brief notice of this person,
whose name was Andrew Davidson.</p>

<p>A literary gentleman, who supplies us with information respecting
him, states that he was once possessed of a considerable estate,—that of
Green-house, in the county of Roxburgh. But being a man of great
wit and humour, his society was courted by young men of idle and
dissipated habits, who led him into such expenses as shortly proved
prejudicial to his fortunes. He was then obliged to sell off his estate
and betake himself to a humbler line of life. Keeping a small grocery
and spirit shop always presents itself to men in such circumstances as a
means of subsistence requiring the least instruction and most easily set
afloat. He accordingly commenced that line of business in Jedburgh;
but, being considered as an intruder into the burgh, and opposing
certain ancient residenters, who were supposed to be more lawfully,
justly, and canonically entitled to trade in the town than any new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">{137}</span>
upstart, he did not meet with that success which he expected. In consequence
of this illiberal treatment, he conceived the most rancorous
hatred for the inhabitants of Jedburgh, and ever after spoke of them
in the most violent terms of hatred and contempt. His common
language was, “that not an individual in the town would be judged
at the last day,—Jedburgh would be at once damned <i>by the slump!</i>”</p>

<p>He again resolved to commence the profession of agriculture, and
took the farm of Habton, in the neighbouring parish of Crailing.
This speculation, however, succeeded no better than the shop. By
associating himself with the opulent farmers and gentlemen of the
vicinity, by whom his company, as a man of wit and jollity, was
always much sought after, his ancient habits of extravagance returned;
and, though in poorer circumstances, being obliged to spend in equal
style with these ruinous friends, the surviving wrecks of his fortune
were soon dissipated, and he was obliged to become a bankrupt.</p>

<p>When a man who has freely lavished his fortune and his humour
in the entertainment of friends above his own rank becomes incapable
of further sacrifice, it is most natural for such friends to forsake and
neglect him. He is considered as no more entitled to their gratitude
than the superannuated player, after he has ceased to be supported by
the immediate exhibition of his powers. There is no Chelsea provided
for the cripples in the cause of the gay.</p>

<p>Mr. Davidson was, however, more fortunate in his companions.
After his misfortune, they induced him to open a house of entertainment
at Ancrum Bridge; laid in for him a stock of wines, spirits, etc.;
made parties at his house; and set him fairly a-going. This was a
line in which he was calculated both to shine and to realize profit. His
company was still as attractive as ever; and it was no longer disgraceful
to receive a solid reward for the entertainment which his
facetiousness could afford. Having also learned a little wisdom from
his former miscarriages, he proceeded with more caution, kept up the
respectability of his house, was polite and amusing to his guests, and,
above all, paid infinite attention to his business.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of character, for which we have placed his name
against that of Caleb Balderstone, here occurs. Whenever there
alighted any stranger of a more splendid appearance than ordinary,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">{138}</span>
he was suddenly seized with a fit of magniloquency, and, in the
identical manner of Caleb Balderstone, would call <i>Hostler No. 10</i> down
from <i>Hay-loft No. 15</i>, to conduct the gentleman’s “beast” to one of
the best stalls in the <i>Stable No. 20</i>! He would then, with a superabundance
of ceremony, show the stranger into a chamber which he
would declare with the greatest assurance to be <i>No. 40</i>; and on his
guest asking perhaps for a glass of rum, would order a waiter, whom
he baptized (<i>nolens volens</i>) <i>No. 15</i> for the occasion, to draw it from
the cask in the bar marked 95. Then was the <i>twelfth</i> hen-roost to be
ransacked, and a glorious fowl, the best that could be selected from a
stock of about <i>one thousand or so</i>, to be consigned to the hands of the
<i>Head Cook</i> herself, (God knows his house boasted only one, who
was <i>Scullion</i> and <i>Boots</i> besides.) All this rhodomontade was enacted
in a style of such serious effrontery, and was accompanied by such a
volubility of talk, and flights of humour, and bustling activity, that any
one not previously acquainted with his devices, would have given him
and his house credit for ten times the size and respectability they could
actually boast of.</p>

<p>Mr. Davidson afterwards removed to the inn at Middleton, where he
died, in good circumstances, about sixteen years ago. He was a man
of very brilliant talents, distinguished much by that faculty entitled
by the country people <i>ready wit</i>. He had a strong memory, a lively
and fertile imagination, and possessed powers of discourse truly astonishing.
The prevailing tone of his mind was disposed to ridicule.
He had a singularly felicitous knack of giving anything improper in
his own conduct or appearance a bias in his favour, and could at all
times, as we have seen, set off his own circumstances in such a light
as made them splendid and respectable, though in reality they were
vulgar and undignified.</p>

</div><p><span class="uppercase">here</span> can be little doubt that the Author of “Waverley” has taken

in a critique on the “Culloden Papers,” in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
which is said to have been written by the Great Novelist’s <i>other self</i>,
Sir Walter Scott.</p>

<p>“The family or sept of Macgregor is of genuine Celtic origin, great
antiquity, and, in Churchill’s phrase,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">From great and glorious, but forgotten kings.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“They were once possessed of Glenurchy, of the castle at the head
of Lochowe, of Glendochart, Glenlyon, Finlarig, Balloch, now called
Taymouth, and of the greater part of Breadalbane. From these
territories they were gradually expelled by the increasing strength of
the Campbells, who, taking advantage of a bloody feud between the
M‘Gregors and M‘Nabs, obtained letters of fire and sword against the
former; and, about the reigns of James III. and IV., dispossessed them
of much of their property. The celebrated M‘Gregor a Rua Rua, the
heir-male of the chief, and a very gallant young man, was surprised and
slain by Colin Campbell, the Knight of Lochowe, and with him fell
the fortunes of his family. From this time, the few lands which remained
not sufficing to support so numerous a clan, the M‘Gregors
became desperate, wild, and lawless, supporting themselves either by
actual depredation, or by the money which they levied as the price of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">{140}</span>
their forbearance, and retaliating upon the more powerful clans, as well
as upon the Lowlands, the severity with which they were frequently
pursued and slaughtered. A single trait of their history will show what
was the ferocity of feud among the Scottish clans.</p>

<p>“The remaining settlements of the M‘Gregor tribe were chiefly in
Balquhidder, around Loch Katrine, as far as the borders of Lochlomond.
Even these lands they did not possess in property, but by
some transactions with the family of Buchanan, who were the real
landholders; but the terrors of the M‘Gregors extended far and wide,
for they were at feud with all their neighbours. In the year 1589, a
party of the M‘Gregors, belonging to a tribe called Clan-Duil a Cheach,
<i>i.e.</i> the children of Dougal of the Mist, (an appropriate name for such a
character,) met with John Drummond of Drummondernoch, who had,
in his capacity of stewart-depute, or provincial magistrate of Strathearn,
tried and executed two or three of these M‘Gregors, for depredations
committed on his chief Lord Drummond’s lands. The Children of the
Mist seized the opportunity of vengeance, slew the unfortunate huntsman,
and cut off his head. They then went to the house of John
Stewart of Ardvoirlich, whose wife was a sister of the murdered
Drummondernoch. The laird was absent, but the lady received the
unbidden and unwelcome guests with hospitality, and, according to
the Highland custom and phrase, placed before them bread and cheese,
till better food could be made ready. She left the room to superintend
the preparations, and when she returned, beheld, displayed upon the
table, the ghastly head of her brother, with a morsel of bread and
cheese in its mouth. The terrified lady rushed out of the house with a
fearful shriek, and could not be found, though her distracted husband
caused all the woods and wildernesses around to be diligently searched.
To augment the misery of Ardvoirlich, his unfortunate wife was with
child when she disappeared. She did not, however, perish. It was
harvest season, and in the woods and moors the maniac wanderer
probably found berries and other substances capable of sustaining life;
though the vulgar, fond of the marvellous, supposed that the wild deer
had pity on her misery, and submitted to be milked by her. At
length some train of former ideas began to revive in her mind. She
had formerly been very attentive to her domestic duties, and used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">{141}</span>
commonly to oversee the milking of the cows; and now the women
employed in that office in the remote upland grazings, observed with
terror, that they were regularly watched during the milking by an
emaciated, miserable-looking, female figure, who appeared from among
the bushes, but retired with great swiftness when any one approached
her. The story was told to Ardvoirlich, who, conjecturing the truth,
took measures for intercepting and recovering the unfortunate fugitive.
She regained her senses after the birth of her child; but it was remarkable,
that the son whom she bore seemed affected by the consequences
of her terror. He was of great strength, but of violent passions, under
the influence of which he killed his friend and commander, Lord
Kilpont, in a manner which the reader will find detailed in Wishart’s
Memoirs of Montrose.</p>

<p>“The tragedy of Drummondernoch did not end with the effects of
the murder on the Lady Ardvoirlich. The clan of the M‘Gregors
being convoked in the church of Balquhidder, upon the Sunday after
the act, the bloody head was produced on the altar, when each clansman
avowed the murder to have been perpetrated by his own consent,
and, laying successively his hands on the scalp, swore to defend and
protect the authors of the deed,—‘in ethnic and barbarous manner,’
says an order of the Lords of the Privy Council, dated 4th February,
1589, ‘in most proud contempt of our Sovereign Lord and his
authority, if this shall remain unpunished.’ Then follows a commission
to search for and pursue Alaster M‘Gregor of Glenstrae, and
all others of his name, with fire and sword. We have seen a letter
upon this subject from Patrick, Lord Drummond, who was naturally
most anxious to avenge his kinsman’s death, to the Earl of Montrose,
appointing a day in which the one shall be ‘at the bottom of the valley
of Balquhidder with his forces, and advance upward, and the other,
with his powers, shall occupy the higher outlet, and move downwards,
for the express purpose of taking <i>sweet revenge</i> for the death of their
cousin.’ Ardvoirlich assisted them with a party, and it is said they
killed thirty-seven of the clan of Dougal of the Mist upon the single
farm of Inverneuty.”—<i>Quarterly Review</i>, vol. xiv., p. 307.</p>

<h3>THE GREAT MONTROSE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> illustrious personage whose fortunes form the ground-work of this
Tale, was the only son of John, fourth Earl of Montrose,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> by Lady
Margaret Ruthven, daughter of William, first Earl of Gowrie.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> He
was born in the year 1612, succeeded his father in 1626, and was
married soon after, while yet very young,—a circumstance which is said
to have somewhat marred his education. He travelled into foreign
parts, where he spent some years in study, and in learning the customary
accomplishments of that period, in which he excelled most
men; and he returned home in 1634.</p>

<p>Meeting with a cold and forbidding reception at Court, his Lordship
joined the supplicants in 1637, and became one of the most zealous
supporters of the Covenant in 1638. Next year he had the command
of the forces sent to the north against the town of Aberdeen, which he
obliged to take the Covenant; and the Marquis of Huntly, who, on
his approach, disbanded the men he had raised, was sent prisoner to
Edinburgh. Lord Aboyne appearing in arms in the north the same
year, Montrose was despatched against him, and totally routed his
forces at the Bridge of Dee. When the pacification of Berwick was
concluded, Montrose was one of the noblemen who paid their respects
to Charles I. at that place in July, 1639.</p>

<p>Next year, an army being raised to march into England, Montrose
had two regiments given him, one of horse and one of foot. He led
the van of that army through the Tweed on foot, and, totally routing
the vanguard of the King’s cavalry, contributed to the victory at Newburn.
But, in 1643, moved with resentment against the Covenanters,
who preferred to his prompt and ardent character the wily and
politic Earl of Argyll, or seeing, perhaps, that the final views of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">{143}</span>
that party were inimical to the interests of monarchy and of the
constitution, Montrose espoused the falling cause of loyalty, and
raised the Highland clans, whom he united to a small body of Irish,
commanded by Alexander Macdonald, still renowned in the north
under the title of Colkitto. With a few troops collected in Westmoreland,
he first raised the royal standard at Dumfries in April, 1644, but
was soon obliged to retire into England; and he was excommunicated
by the commission of the General Assembly.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> To atone, however, for
so severe a denunciation, the King, about this time, raised him to the
dignity of Marquis; and he soon after had the pleasure of routing the
Parliament army at Morpeth. He was next successful in throwing
provisions into Newcastle. After the defeat of Prince Rupert at
Marston Moor in July, 1644, he left his men with that general, and
went to Scotland. At this period of his adventures the Author of
“Waverley” takes him up in his “Legend of Montrose.”</p>

<p>Disguised as a groom, with only two attendants, Montrose arrived in
Strathearn, where he continued till rumour announced the approach of
1500 Irish, who, after ravaging the northern extremity of Argyllshire,
had landed in Skye, and traversed the extensive districts of Lochaber
and Badenoch. On descending into Atholl in August, 1644, they
were surprised with the unexpected appearance of their general, Montrose,
in the garb of a Highlander, with a single attendant; but his
name was sufficient to increase his army to 3000, for commanding
whom he had the King’s warrant. He attacked an army of Covenanters,
amounting to upwards of 6000 foot and horse, at Tippermuir, 1st
September, totally routed them, and took their artillery and baggage,
without losing a man. Perth immediately surrendered to the victor;
but, Argyll approaching, he abandoned that place as untenable, took
all the cannon, ammunition, and spoil of the town with him, and went
north. He defeated the Covenanters a second time at the Bridge of
Dee, on the 12th of September; and, continuing the pursuit to the
gates of Aberdeen, entered the town with the vanquished. The pillage
of the ill-fated burgh was doomed to expiate the principles which Montrose
himself had formerly imposed upon them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">{144}</span></p>
<p>Argyll came from Stirling to Perth on the 10th of September; and
his army following him in a desultory manner, is said to have taken
about a week in passing through the latter town.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He passed the Tay
in boats, which Montrose had left undestroyed, and pursued that
general to the north. Meanwhile, Montrose had left Aberdeen, and
sought the assistance of the Gordons; but finding the Spey well
guarded, he retreated over the mountains to Badenoch, burying his
artillery in a morass. He descended into Atholl and Angus, pursued
by Argyll, but by a sudden march repassed the Grampians, and returned
to rouse the Gordons to arms! At Fyvie, he was almost
surprised by Argyll, 27th October, 1644, but maintained a situation,
advantageously chosen, against the reiterated attacks of a superior
army, till night, when he made good his retreat into Badenoch. He
immediately proceeded into Argyllshire, which he ravaged, and sentence
of forfeiture was passed against him in Parliament.</p>

<p>So extraordinary were the evolutions of Montrose, that on many
occasions the appearance of his army was the first notice the enemy
had of his approach; and of his retreats, the first intelligence was that
he was beyond their reach. Argyll, exasperated with the devastation
of his estates, marched against Montrose; but he, not waiting to be
attacked, marched thirty miles, by an unfrequented route, across the
mountains of Lochaber, during a heavy fall of snow, and came at night
in front of the enemy, when they believed him in a different part of the
country. This was in February, 1645, during a very inclement season.
“The moon shone so clear,” says Bishop Wishart, “that it was almost
as light as day. They lay upon their arms the whole night, and, with
the assistance of the light, so harassed each other with slight alarms
and skirmishes, that neither gave the other time to repose. They all
wished earnestly for day: only Argyll, more intent on his own safety,
conveyed himself away about the middle of the night: and, having very
opportunely got a boat, escaped the hazard of a battle, choosing rather
to be a spectator of the prowess of his men than share in the danger
himself. Nevertheless, the chiefs of the Campbells, who were indeed a
set of very brave men, and worthy of a better chief and a better cause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">{145}</span>
began the battle with great courage. But the first ranks discharging
their muskets only once, Montrose’s men fell in upon them furiously,
sword in hand, with a great shout, and advanced with such great impetuosity,
that they routed the whole army, and put them to flight, and
pursued them for about nine miles, making dreadful slaughter the
whole way. There were 1500 of the enemy slain, among whom were
several gentlemen of distinction of the name of Campbell, who led on
the clan, and fell in the field of battle, too gallantly for their dastardly
chief. Montrose, though an enemy, pitied their fate, and used his
authority to save and give quarter to as many as he could. In this
battle Montrose had several wounded, but he had none killed but three
privates, and Sir Thomas Ogilvie, son of the Earl of Airley; whilst
Argyll lost the Lairds of Auchinbreck, Glensaddell, and Lochnell,
with his son and brother, and Barbreck, Inneraw, Lamont, Silvercraigs,
and many other prisoners.” Spalding, in his “History of the
Troubles,” states, that “there came direct from the committee of
Edinburgh certain men to see Argyll’s forwardness in following Montrose,
but they saw his flight, in manner foresaid. It is to be considered
that few of this army could have escaped if Montrose had not
marched the day before the fight thirty-three miles, (Scots miles) on
little food, and crossed sundry waters, wet and weary, and standing in
wet and cold the hail night before the fight.”</p>

<p>Montrose, flushed with victory, now proceeded to Moray, where he
was joined by the Gordons and Grants. He next marched to the
southward, taking Dundee by storm; but being attacked by a superior
force under Baillie and Hurry, began to retreat. Baillie and Hurry
divided their forces, to prevent his return to the north; but, by a
masterly movement, he passed between their divisions, and regained
the mountains. He defeated Hurry at Meldrum, near Nairn, on the
14th May, 1645, by a manœuvre similar to that of Epaminondas at
Leuctra and Mantinea. In that battle, the left wing of the Royalists
was commanded by Montrose’s able auxiliary, Alister Macdonell, or
Maccoul, (as he is called in Gaelic) still celebrated in Highland
tradition and song for his chivalry and courage. An elevation of
ground separated the wings. Montrose received a report that Macdonell’s
wing had given way, and was retreating. He instantly ran<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">{146}</span>
along the ranks, and called out to his men that Macdonell was driving
the enemy before him, and, unless they did the same, the other wing
would carry away all the glory of the day. His men instantly rushed
forward, and charged the enemy off the field, while he hastened with
his reserve to the relief of his friend, and recovered the fortune of the
day.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> At this battle, in which 2000 Covenanters fell, Campbell of
Lawers, though upwards of seventy years of age, fought on the Presbyterian
side, with a two-handed broadsword, till himself, and four of his
six sons, who were with him, fell on the ground on which they stood.
Such was the enemy which the genius and courage of Montrose overcame.
Pursuing his victory, Montrose encountered and defeated
Baillie at Alford, on the 2nd of July; but on this occasion his success
was embittered by the loss of Lord Gordon, who fell in the action.
His victories attracted reinforcements from all parts of the country: he
marched to the southward at the head of 6000 men, and fought a
bloody and decisive battle near Kilsyth, on the 15th August, when
nearly 5000 Covenanters fell under the Highland claymore.</p>

<p>This last and greatest of his splendid successes opened the whole of
Scotland to Montrose. He occupied Glasgow and the capital, and
marched forward to the border, not merely to complete the subjection
of the southern provinces, but with the flattering hope of pouring his
victorious army into England, and bringing to the support of Charles
the swords of his paternal tribes.</p>

<p>Montrose was now, however, destined to endure a reverse of his
hitherto brilliant fortune. After traversing the border counties, and
receiving little assistance or countenance from the chiefs of these districts,
he encamped on Philiphaugh, a level plain near Selkirk, extending
about a mile and a half along the banks of the rivers Tweed and
Ettrick. Here he posted his infantry, amounting to about 1500 men,
while he himself and his cavalry, to the amount of about 1000, took up
their quarters in the town of Selkirk.</p>

<p>Recalled by the danger<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of the cause of the Covenant, General David
Lesly came down from England at the head of those iron squadrons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">{147}</span>
whose force had been proved in the fatal battle of Long Marston Moor.
His army consisted of from 5000 to 6000 men, chiefly cavalry. Lesly’s
first plan seems to have been to occupy the midland counties, so as to
intercept the return of Montrose’s Highlanders, and to force him to an
unequal combat. Accordingly, he marched along the eastern coast
from Berwick to Tranent; but there he suddenly altered his direction,
and, crossing through Midlothian, turned again to the southward, and,
following the course of Gala Water, arrived at Melrose the evening
before the engagement. How it is possible that Montrose should have
received no notice whatever of the march of so considerable an army
seems almost inconceivable, and proves that the country was very
disaffected to his cause or person. Still more extraordinary does it
appear, that, even with the advantage of a thick mist, Lesly should
have, the next morning, advanced towards Montrose’s encampment
without being descried by a single scout. Such, however, was the case,
and it was attended with all the consequences of a complete surprisal.
The first intimation that Montrose received of the march of Lesly was
the noise of the conflict, or rather that which attended the unresisted
slaughter of his infantry, who never formed a line of battle: the right
wing alone, supported by the thickets of Harehead-wood, and by their
entrenchments, stood firm for some time. But Lesly had detached
2000 men, who, crossing the Ettrick still higher up than his main body,
assaulted the rear of Montrose’s right wing. At this moment the
Marquis arrived, and beheld his army dispersed, for the first time, in
irretrievable rout. He had thrown himself upon a horse the instant he
heard the firing, and, followed by such of his disordered cavalry as had
gathered upon the alarm, he galloped from Selkirk, crossed the Ettrick,
and made a bold and desperate attempt to retrieve the fortune of the
day. But all was in vain; and after cutting his way, almost singly,
through a body of Lesly’s troopers, the gallant Montrose graced by his
example the retreat of the fugitives. That retreat he continued up
Yarrow, and over Minchmoor; nor did he stop till he arrived at
Traquair, 16 miles from the field of battle. He lodged the first night
at the town of Peebles.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Upon Philiphaugh he lost, in one defeat, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">{148}</span>
fruit of six splendid victories; nor was he again able effectually to make
head in Scotland against the covenanted cause. The number slain in
the field did not exceed 300 or 400; for the fugitives found refuge in
the mountains, which had often been the retreat of vanquished armies,
and were impervious to the pursuer’s cavalry. Lesly abused his victory,
and disgraced his arms, by slaughtering in cold blood many of the
prisoners whom he had taken; and the court-yard of Newark Castle is
said to have been the spot upon which they were shot by his command.
Many others are said by Wishart to have been precipitated from a high
bridge over the Tweed,—a circumstance considered doubtful by Laing,
as there was then no bridge over the Tweed between Peebles and
Berwick, though the massacre might have taken place at either of the
old bridges over the Ettrick and Yarrow, which lay in the very line of
flight and pursuit. It is too certain that several of the Royalists were
executed by the Covenanters, as traitors to the King and Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>After this reverse of fortune,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Montrose retired into the north. In
1646, he formed an association with the Earls of Sutherland and Seaforth,
and other Highland chieftains, and they laid siege to Inverness;
but General Middleton forced Montrose to retreat, with considerable
loss. Charles I. now sending orders to Montrose to disband his forces
and leave the kingdom, he capitulated with Middleton, July, 1646, and
an indemnity was granted to his followers, and he was permitted to
retire to the continent. The capitulation was ratified by Parliament,
and Montrose was permitted to remain unmolested in Scotland for a
month to settle his affairs.</p>

<p>He now proceeded to France, where he resided two years. He had
the offer of the appointments of general of the Scots in France, lieutenant-general
of the French army, captain of the <i>gens d’armes</i>,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> with
an annual pension of 12,000 crowns, and a promise of being promoted
to the rank of <i>maréchal</i>, and to the captaincy of the King’s guards, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">{149}</span>
which preferments he declined, as he wished only to be of service to his
own King. He retired privately from Paris, in May, 1648, and went
to Germany, from thence to Brussels, where he was, at the period of
the King’s execution, in 1649. He then repaired to the Hague, where
Charles II. resided, and offered to establish him on the throne of
Scotland by force. The King gave him a commission accordingly, and
invested him with the order of the garter. Montrose, with arms
supplied by the court of Sweden, and money by Denmark, embarked at
Hamburg, with 600 Germans, and landed in Orkney in spring 1650,
where he got some recruits, and crossed over to Caithness with an army
of about 1400 men; and he was joined by several Royalists as he
traversed the wilds of Sutherland. But, advancing into Ross-shire, he
was surprised, and totally defeated, at Invercharron, by Colonel
Strachan, an officer of the Scottish Parliament, who afterwards became
a decided Cromwellian. Montrose’s horse was shot under him; but he
was generously remounted by his friend, Lord Frendraught. After a
fruitless resistance, he at length fled from the field, threw away his
ribbon and George, changed clothes with a countryman, and thus
escaped to the house of M‘Leod of Assint,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> by whom he was betrayed
to General Lesly.</p>

<p>Whatsoever indignities the bitterness of party rage or religious hatred
could suggest, were accumulated on a fallen, illustrious enemy, formerly
terrible, and still detested. He was slowly and ostentatiously conducted
through the north by the ungenerous Lesly, in the same mean habit
in which he was taken. His devastations were not forgotten,—his
splendid victories never forgiven,—and he was exposed, by excommunication,
to the abhorrence and insults of a fanatical people. His
sentence was already pronounced in Parliament, on his former attainder,
under every aggravation which brutal minds can delight to inflict. He
was received by the magistrates of Edinburgh at the Watergate, 18th
May, 1650, placed on an elevated seat in a cart, to which he was
pinioned with cords, and, preceded by his officers, coupled together,
was conducted, bareheaded, by the public executioner, to the common
jail. But his magnanimity was superior to every insult. When produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">{150}</span>
to receive his sentence in Parliament, he was upbraided by the
Chancellor with his violation of the Covenant, the introduction of Irish
insurgents, his invasion of Scotland during a treaty with the King; and
the temperate dignity which he had hitherto sustained, seemed, at first,
to yield to indignant contempt. He vindicated his dereliction of the
Covenant, by their rebellion,—his appearance in arms, by the commission
of his Sovereign,—and declared, that as he had formerly deposited,
so he again resumed his arms, by his Majesty’s command, to accelerate
the treaty commenced with the States. A barbarous sentence, which
he received with an undaunted countenance, was then pronounced by a
Parliament who acknowledged Charles to be their King, and whom, on
that account only, Montrose acknowledged to be a Parliament,—that
he should be hanged for three hours, on a gibbet 30 feet high; that his
head should be affixed to the common jail, his limbs to the gates of
the principal towns, and his body interred at the place of execution,
unless his excommunication were taken off, and then it might be buried
in consecrated ground. With dignified magnanimity, he replied, that
he was prouder to have his head affixed to the prison walls than his
picture placed in the King’s bedchamber; “and, far from being
troubled that my limbs are to be sent to your principal towns, I wish
I had flesh enough to be dispersed through Christendom, to attest my
dying attachment to my King.” It was the calm employment of his
mind that night to reduce this extravagant sentiment to verse. He
appeared next day on the scaffold, in a rich habit, with the same serene
and undaunted countenance, and addressed the people, to vindicate his
dying unabsolved by the Church, rather than to justify an invasion of
the kingdom during a treaty with the Estates. The insults of his
enemies were not yet exhausted. The history of his exploits, which had
been written in Latin by Bishop Wishart, and published all over
Europe, was attached to his neck by the executioner; but he smiled at
their inventive malice, declared that he wore it with more pride than
he had done the garter, and when his devotions were finished, demanding
if any more indignities were to be practised, submitted calmly to an
unmerited fate.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Thus perished, at the age of thirty-eight, the gallant Marquis of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">{151}</span>
Montrose, with the reputation of one of the first commanders that the
civil wars had produced. He excelled in the stratagems of war; but
his talents were rather those of an active, enterprising partisan, than of
a great commander,—better fitted to excite and manage a desultory
war, than to direct the complicated operations of a regular campaign.
He may be admired for his genius, but he cannot be praised for his
wisdom. Though he excelled in the performance of rapid movements,
and had the quick eye of a serpent approaching its prey, he had not the
firmness, perseverance, and vigilance which form the necessary qualifications
of a great general. Most of his victories were gained by the
celerity of his approaches and the impetuosity of his attacks, yet he did
not prove himself any better qualified to avert the fatal consequences of
surprise than those whom his manœuvres had so often defeated. His
genius was great and romantic, in the opinion of Cardinal de Retz, no
mean judge of human nature, approaching the nearest to the ancient
heroes of Greece and Rome. But his heroism was wild and extravagant,
and was less conspicuous during his life than from the fortitude
with which he sustained an ignominious death.</p>

<p>Montrose’s sentence, in all circumstances, was executed <i>ad literam</i>.
His head was stuck upon the tolbooth of Edinburgh, where it remained,
blackening in the sun, when his master, Charles II., soon thereafter
arrived in the Scottish metropolis. His limbs were dispersed to Perth,
Glasgow, Stirling, and Aberdeen, and his body was buried at the place
of execution, from whence it was afterwards removed to the common
moor,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> whence it was lifted at the Restoration. On this event, when
Charles found opportunity for testifying his respect for Montrose, his
scattered remains were collected. There was a scaffold erected at the
tolbooth, and some ceremony was used in taking down his head from
its ignominious situation. According to Kirkton,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> some bowed and
some knelt while that relic was removed from the spike, which was
done by Montrose’s kinsman, the Laird of Gorthie, who, according to
the covenanting account, died <i>in consequence</i>, after performing his
triumphant but melancholy duty. The Laird of Pitcurre, too, who in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">{152}</span>
his joy had drunk a little too much on the occasion, was, by the same
account, found dead in his bed next morning; though we find little
hesitation in giving the brandy more of the credit due to that event
than what the Presbyterian annalist is pleased to call “the pleasure
of Heaven.” Montrose’s remains were deposited in Holyroodhouse,
where they remained some time in state; and, on the 14th of May,
1651, they were buried, with great pomp and ceremony, in the cathedral
church of St. Giles.</p>

<p class="p2">Such is a brief but correct historical detail of the events which the
Author of “Waverley” has confounded and misrepresented, for his own
purposes, in the “Legend of Montrose.” We have given at best but a
meagre outline of the events, but as they run in their proper series, our
narrative will serve to correct the irregularity into which the Great
Novelist has thrown them. It may here be observed, that the last
event in the Tale is the attempted murder of Lord Menteith, which our
Author has placed after the battle of Inverlochy. Now this circumstance,
which was of real occurrence, took place on the 6th of September,
1644, a few days after the battle of Tippermuir, whereas the battle
of Inverlochy happened on the 1st of February, 1645, five months after.
We have made some collections respecting the assassination, and give
the result.</p>

<p>John, Lord Kinpont, the Lord Menteith of the “Legend of Montrose,”
was the eldest son of William, seventh Earl of Menteith, and
first Earl of Airth, who rendered himself remarkable in the reign of
Charles I. by saying that he had “the reddest blood in Scotland,”
alluding to his descent from Euphemia Ross, then supposed the first
wife of Robert II.,—in consequence of which expression he was disgraced
and imprisoned by his offended Sovereign. Lord Kinpont
married, in 1632, Lady Mary Keith, a daughter of Earl Marishal; consequently
he could not be the hero and lover which he is represented
to have been in the fiction, and the story of Allan Macaulay’s rivalry,
which prompted him to the wicked deed, must be entirely groundless.
Kinpont joined Montrose in August, 1644, with recruits to the amount
of 400 men, and was present at the battle of Tippermuir, immediately
following. A few days thereafter, James Stewart, of Ardvoirlich, basely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">{153}</span>
murdered his Lordship at Colace, in Perthshire. A different colour is
given to this circumstance by different narrators. A citizen of Perth,
who wrote a manuscript giving an account of some remarkable events
in his own time, (quoted in “<i>The Muse’s Threnodie</i>,”) says simply that
Stewart committed the murder “because Lord Kinpont had joined
Montrose.” But, in Guthrie’s Memoirs, we find, that “Stewart having
proposed to his Lordship a plan to assassinate Montrose, of which Lord
Kinpont signified his abhorrence, as disgraceful and devilish, the other,
without more ado, lest he should discover him, stabbed him to the
heart, and immediately fled to the Covenanters, by whom he was
pardoned and promoted.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Marquis of Montrose, deeply affected
with the loss of so noble a friend, gave orders for conveying his body
in an honourable manner to Menteith, where he was interred.” In the
“Staggering State of Scots Statesmen,”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> we find the following passage:—“The
Lord Kinpont, being with James Graham in the time of
the late troubles, was stabbed with a dirk by one Alexander Stewart,
and his lady, daughter of the Earl of Marishal, was distracted in her
wits four years after.” Here a remarkable discrepancy is observable.
The assassin is termed <i>Alexander</i>, whereas every other authority gives
<i>James</i> as his Christian name. Yet this discordance in names is not
more worthy of remark than another of the same description, which we
are about to point out to the amateurs of the Scotch Novels, as occurring
in the Tale before us. In the first edition of this Tale (1819) at
the 321st page of the third volume, the Great Unknown, for once, forgets
the fictitious appellation Macaulay, and terms the visionary brother
Allen <i>Stuart</i>, which, we think, completely serves to identify the above
story with the dreadful one in the “Tale.”</p>

<p>Wishart says, that such was the friendship and familiarity of Kinpont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">{154}</span>
with his murderer, that they had slept in the same bed the night
previous to the horrid deed, which took place, it appears, in the grey
of the morning. It is true that he killed also “the centinel who stood
at the entry of the camp, it being so dark that those who pursued him
could not see the length of their pikes. Montrose was very much
afflicted with the untimely fate of this nobleman, who had been his own
special friend, and most faithful and loyal to the King his master, and
who, besides his knowledge in polite literature, philosophy, divinity,
and law, was eminent for his probity and fortitude.”—<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 84.</p>

<h3 title="PHILIPHAUGH.">PHILIPHAUGH.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></h3>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe4_0625" id="i_p_154">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_154.jpg" alt="S" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">elkirk</span> lies on the face of a long range of hills stretching from
north to south. The Ettrick water, a pretty little river, runs at their
base. A bridge of four arches crosses the stream, and carries the road
from the low, flat, and swampy plain of Philiphaugh, up the eminence,
in a gracefully winding direction, to the town. A mountain streamlet,
called the Shawburn, disembogues itself at the bridge. This in summer
is quite dry, but in winter, or during wet weather, descends in
torrents, and assists the Ettrick in overflowing the field of Philiphaugh.
This celebrated field is now partly inclosed, and bears a few patches of
turnips; but the chief produce seems to be rushes, a species of crop
which may perhaps yield little comfort to the agriculturist, but which
will give a more than proportionable pleasure to the amateur, assuring
him that the ground has lost little of its original character, and is much
the same now as when it was trod by Montrose.</p>

<p>The hill on which Selkirk stands is studded round with neat gentlemen’s
seats, and forms a striking contrast with those on the opposite
side of Philiphaugh, which are uniformly dark, bleak, and unproductive.
Sheltered by one of these, and situated directly south from
Selkirk, there stands, in the ravine formed by the Shawburn, a little
cottage thatched in the Scottish fashion, with the usual accompaniments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">{155}</span>
of a <i>kail-yard</i>, a <i>midden</i><a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> before the door, and a <i>jaw-hole</i>. The inhabitants
of this humble tenement, if, like us, you be driven in by
stress of weather, will be very obliging in telling all they know about
Philiphaugh, and how Montrose galloped “up the burn and away over
Minchmoor,” in his retreat before Lesly’s victorious army. They will
likewise tell an indistinct story about a division of Lesly’s troops, which,
led by a countryman, came down this way in order to cut off his
retreat. This evidently alludes to the circumstance of Lesly despatching
a body of his horse across the river to attack Montrose’s right
wing in the rear, upon which the unfortunate general, finding himself
hemmed in on all sides, cut his way through his foes, and abandoned
the field.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> In corroboration of what we suppose, the inhabitant of the
cottage points out several <i>tumuli</i> or mounds<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> on a little peninsula
formed by a sweep of the stream, where the conflict had been greatest.
He also speaks of having now and then dug up in his potato-field the
remains of human bones.</p>

<p>This <i>cicerone</i> of Philiphaugh is a very singular-looking man, and well
merits the little attention which you may feel disposed to pay him. He
is what is called a country weaver—that is, a person who converts into
cloth the thread and yarn spun by the industrious female peasantry of
his neighbourhood. It is not perhaps generally known—at least among
our southern neighbours—that the common people of Scotland in general
manufacture their own clothes, and that from the first carding of the
wool to the induing of the garment. The assistance of the weaver and
the dyer is indeed required; but every other department of the business
they are themselves fit to undertake,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and sometimes the aid of the dyer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">{156}</span>
is entirely dispensed with, when the cloth, bearing the natural colour
of the wool, is termed <i>hodden-grey</i>, an expression to which Burns has
given a more than ordinary interest. The weaver is usually a person
of no little importance in a rural district; for his talents are in universal
request. The specimen of the craft now before us was unusually poor,
and, not being free of the Selkirk incorporation, was, like the Paria of
the Indian tale, obliged to fly from the customary haunts of his brethren,
and seek an asylum in this solitary place. According to his own
account of his affairs, he “daikers on here in a very sma’ way,” but
when he can get <i>customer-wark</i>, has no occasion to complain. <i>Customer-wark</i>
is the species of employment which we have described, and
he says that he can make eighteen-pence a day by it, which seems to
him to constitute a superlative degree of prosperity. We visited his
loom, which we found half embedded in the damp earth in a low-roofed
part of the cottage, and separated from the domestic establishment by
two large wooden beds. Here he seemed engaged upon a piece of
woollen cloth at least half an inch thick, the surface of which appeared
fully as rough and unequal as the map of Selkirkshire in our good friend
Mr. John Thomson’s Scottish Atlas. One peculiarity in his method of
working is worthy of remark. Instead of impelling the shuttle in the
improved modern manner, by means of a simple piece of mechanism,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">{157}</span>
he sent it through the web by his hands, throwing it from the right and
receiving it into the left, and <i>vice versa</i>, while the hand immediately
unemployed with the shuttle, was employed for the instant in drawing
the <i>lay</i> in upon the thread. This old fashion, which formerly prevailed
in every species of weaving, is now disused by all the Glasgow manufacturers
and others who work upon fine materials, and is only kept up
in remote parts by the coarse country weavers. We entered into a
discussion of the various merits and demerits of different sorts of work;
and found that Glasgow was blessed with no share of the goodwill of
our friend the weaver. Jaconets, blunks, ginghams, and cambrics were
alternately brought up, and each successively declared stale, flat, and
unprofitable, in comparison with the coarse stuff upon which he was
now employed. <i>Customer-wark</i> was superior to every other work;
and customer-wark was, indeed, the very god of his divinity. <i>Customer-wark</i>
seemed to give a sort of <i>character</i> to his conversation, for the
phrase was generally introduced three or four times into, and formed
the termination of, every sentence. When he paused for breath, he
recommenced with “customer-wark;” and this ludicrous technical
accented every cadence. The world was to the weaver all a desert,
wherein only one resting-place existed—<i>customer-wark</i>!</p>

<p>The poor weaver’s workshop is a miserable-looking place, and so
damp that the walls have a yellow tinge, which also affects the three-paned
window, through which the light finds its way with difficulty.
The family pig is disposed in the same place,—an unusual mark of
squalor and poverty. The weaver tells that his loom now occupies the
precise spot on which the tent of Montrose formerly stood; but this
can scarcely be correct, as, by all accounts, the general resided, with all
his horse, in the town of Selkirk.</p>

<p>When we visited Philiphaugh, in September, 1824, we entered fully
into the spirit of the weaver, and on that occasion extended our observations
to his wife, who is a tall, hollow woman, with dark eyes, and
who speaks and smokes with equal assiduity. The result of our investigation
was the following versified sketch, in which we have endeavoured
to give the reader a complete idea of that hitherto nondescript
animal, a country weaver: his feelings, fortunes, family,
domestic economy, and—above all—his <i>customer-wark!</i></p>

<h3>A VILLAGE ANTIQUARY.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Captain Clutterbuck.</i>)</p>

<div class="ddropcapbox illowe3_75" id="i_p_164">
  <img class="w100 idropcap" src="images/i_p_164.jpg" alt="C" />
</div><p><span class="uppercase">aptain</span> Clutterbuck, the amusing personage who introduces
“The Monastery” and “Nigel,” and who employed himself so
agreeably during the half-pay part of his life in showing off the ruins of
St. Mary’s, finds a happy counterpart in Mr., <i>vulgo</i> Captain O——n, a
gentleman well known in Melrose as an amateur cicerone of “<i>the
Abbey</i>.” His peculiarities and pursuits very nearly resemble those of
the fictitious Clutterbuck. He differs from him in this,—that he never
was engaged in foreign service, having merely held some rank in a provincial
corps of volunteers; but in every other respect he bears a
striking resemblance. He is a staid, elderly person, about fifty,
dresses like a gentleman,—that is, a Melrose gentleman,—and parades
about his native village with a swagger of military gentility in his air,
such as the possession of a walking-cane and the title of <i>Captain</i> seems
alone capable of inspiring in the legs of mankind.</p>

<p>He possesses as much property in the neighbourhood of Melrose as
would entitle him to the honourable appellation, <i>Laird</i>; but in his case
that enviable title is merged in the more romantic and splendid one of
<i>Captain</i>, of which he is, perhaps, ambitious. He has his property in
his own hands, and by its means contrives to keep himself independent.
He thus wavers between the species of the half-pay officer and the cock-laird,
and has no particular claims upon a distinct classification with
either. He is chiefly genteel and idle, and associates a good deal with
that regular hanger-on in all country villages, the exciseman. Having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">{165}</span>
by some chance got the title of Captain affixed to his name, (in truth, he
was only sergeant of a local militia corps,) he persists in retaining, by
abstinence from personal labour, what otherwise he would have forfeited.
The dignity which he contrives to maintain in his native town is
scarcely wonderful, when we consider how few are ever independent in
such a community, and to what a degree the respect of the illiterate is
calculated to be excited by the possession of a very little knowledge,—such
as Captain O. would easily acquire in the course of his unoccupied
life, and which the opportunities of ease did not fail to confer upon even
David Ritchie. Besides, to speak in the deferential words of Captain
Clutterbuck’s Kennaquhair Club, “The Captain has something in him
after a’—few folk ken sae mickle about the Abbey.” O.’s knowledge
upon this point is indeed well calculated to excite the astonishment and
veneration of the natives. He has not only driven the grave-digger
fairly off the field, who, in the reality of Melrose, as well as in the
ideality of Kennaquhair, was the former cicerone of the ruins,—but he
is even a formidable rival to the ingenious John Bower himself. Old
David Kyle, who kept the head inn at Melrose, and who is the <i>David</i>
of the Introduction here illustrated, was in the frequent practice of
calling upon Captain O. for the purpose there so humorously described,
namely, to press his knowledge into the service of his guests. Upon
such occasions of importance, the Captain would, and still does, march
away, with great pomposity, at the head of his company, like a peripatetic
philosopher declaiming to a troop of disciples, and by the way
<i>lays off</i>, as he terms it, all he has ever been able to discover respecting
the valuable remains of St. Mary’s,—and sometimes more than all!
How, then, will his eloquence expand over crypts and chancels, naves
and arches! With what an important sound will the point of his
walking cane ring against the tomb of Michael Scott! And, above all,
how will the surrounding cockneys stare in admiration, when, in the
course of his lecture, he chances to emit some such grandly unintelligible
word as <i>architrave</i> or <i>transept</i>.</p>

<p>Captain O.’s intelligence chiefly lies among the vulgar traditionary
opinions which are entertained regarding the ruins by the country
people; and he knows comparatively little of the lore with which
written records and authentic treatises instruct the general antiquary.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">{166}</span>
Mr. Bower is a person of better authority than the Captain, and has
even published descriptions of the Abbey; but, notwithstanding, the
Captain is not without his party in the town, and it is generally
remarked that his anecdotes, if not so true, are at least as entertaining.
A sort of jealousy sometimes is observable between these rival Ciceroni,
a remarkable anecdote of which is recorded. Upon the opening of
some ancient grave within the ruins, a noseless bust of St. Peter
happened to be found, which it pleased Captain O. to take under his
immediate protection. Bower had found some other remarkable idol in
another part of the Abbey, to which he endeavoured to collect as many
votaries of curiosity as possible; but the rival statue, which the Captain
had already christened by the <i>taking</i> name of Michael Scott, drew off a
sweeping sect from the more legitimate shrine. Bower then endeavoured
to prove that this was no statue of the wizard at all, but merely
one of the common herd of saints, who had formerly figured in the
niches of the building. Of this he at last succeeded in convincing all
concerned, to the discomfiture of his rival. But, nevertheless, the
Captain would not give up his point. He continued pertinacious in
maintaining the authenticity of his noseless <i>protégé</i>, in spite of all
detractions, in spite of all heresies; till at last finding the whole world
against him, he gave up his argument, and turned off the whole as a
joke, with the facetious observation, that “It was just as good a Michael
Scott as could have been found among the whole ruins, if they would
only have held with it!”</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the course of exhibition, there occur distresses nearly
resembling that which happened to Captain Clutterbuck, in the company
of the Benedictine,—that is to say, he “finds himself a scholar when he
came to teach,” by the strangers actually knowing more of his favourite
study than himself. This happens most frequently in the case of
“gentlemen from Edinburgh,”—elderly persons with black coats and
low-crowned hats, which may be called the costume of terror to our
antiquary. To these habiliments, if we add the circumstance of hair-powder,
O——n would as soon face a hyena as any person so clothed.
He is said to fly from a wig as from a pestilence.</p>

<p>Yet, even in these predicaments, the Captain is never entirely at a
loss. Repulsed from one stone, he can retreat to another; refuted in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">{167}</span>
part of his intelligence, he can make an honourable stand at another,
of which his visitors had not been aware; and, even when found to be
wholly fabulous and absurd in his anecdotes, he can, as a <i>dernier resort</i>,
turn them off with some pleasantry or other, which is, of course, irrefragable.
Besides, even when he catches a complete, resolute, <span class="smcap">Antiquarian</span>
Tartar, he generally contrives to profit by the encounter, by picking up
some new intelligence, which he adds to his own former stock.</p>

<p>In describing this part of the character of a local antiquary, with all
his ignorance and all his fables, it is forced upon our observation, how
little certain information is commonly to be found, concerning the relics
of antiquity, among those who dwell in their immediate neighbourhood.
They know that there is an “<i>auld abbey</i>” or a “<i>queer sort o’
stane</i>,” near them; but for any more particular notice of their history,
you might as well inquire in a different quarter of the globe. We have
known instances of people, whose playground in infancy, and whose
daily walks in manhood, had been among the ruins of an ancient
Collegiate Church, (not the least interesting in the kingdom,) being yet
quite ignorant of every circumstance connected with it, except that it
was “<i>just the auld Kirk</i>.”</p>

<p>“It not unfrequently happened,” says Captain Clutterbuck, in his
amusing account of himself, “that an acquaintance which commenced
in the Abbey concluded in the Inn, which served to relieve the solitude
as well as the monotony of my landlady’s shoulder of mutton, whether
hot, cold, or hashed.” This happened not more frequently in the case
of Captain Clutterbuck than it does in that of Captain O——n. The
latter personage, indeed, makes a constant practice of living entirely
with his <i>eleves</i> during their stay in Melrose; and, as they have been
guests at the hospitable board of his learning and entertainment, so he
in turn becomes a guest at the parade of their “bottle of sherry, minced
collops, and fowl,” or whatever else the order upon David Kyle may
be. He is thus always ready at the elbows of their ignorance, to
explain and to exhibit the various petty curiosities of the place, of which
it is probable they might otherwise be obliged to remain perfectly unknowing,
but for the condescending attention of Captain O. He is not
destitute of other means of entertainment, besides showing the Abbey.
He can tell a good story, after a few glasses, and is an excellent hand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">{168}</span>
at a song. “The Broom of the Cowdenknows” is his favourite and his
best; but we are also tenderly attached to “The Flowers of the Forest,”
which he gives in the milkmaid style, with much pathos. When his
company is agreeable, he can (about the tenth tumbler,) treat them with
“Willie brewed a peck o’ Maut,” or “Auld Lang Syne,” or “For a’
that and a’ that.” These infatuating lyrics he gives in such a style of
appropriate enthusiasm, that if his companions have at all a spark of
Burns’s fire in their composition, they will rise up and join hands round
the table, and, at the conclusion of every stanza, drink down immense
cups of kindness, till, in the springtide of their glory, they imagine
themselves the most jolly, patriotic, and independent Scotsmen upon
the face of the earth. Such is the deceiving effect of a national song
upon the spirits of men of sober reason when prepared for the excitement
by previous intoxication. This trait is also not without its parallel
in Clutterbuck. The reader will remember how, in the Introduction
to Nigel, he pathetically laments that since Catalani visited the ruins,
his “Poortith Cauld” has been received both poorly and coldly, and his
“Banks of Doon” been fairly coughed down, at the Club. May the
vocal exertions of Captain O——n, however, never meet with such a
scurvy reception among the cognoscenti of Melrose!</p>

<p>Such are the characteristics of the prototype of Captain Clutterbuck,
as we have gathered them from persons who have been acquainted with
him, natives of the same town. We learn that there is another person
of the same description in Melrose, named Captain T——t, who was
really a Captain, but of a man-of-war, instead of a regiment. May he
not have been the <i>Captain Doolittle</i> of “The Monastery”? The grave-digger
of Kennaquhair, who has the honour of speaking a few words in
that work, must have been John Martin, who was professor of the same
trade in Melrose. He is now dead. Mr. David Kyle, a very respectable
and worthy man, who kept the Cross Keys Inn at Melrose, is also
dead. He was in the custom of keeping an album in his house, for the
amusement of his guests; though we cannot say as to the truth of his
having had a copy of the “great Dr. Samuel Johnson’s <i>Tower</i> to the
Hebrides, in his parlour window, wi’ the twa boards torn aff.” In the
album, to which we had access, is the following very curious document,
among much nonsense:—</p>

<p>The character of Captain Clutterbuck, taken abstractedly from all
consideration of its prototype, may be said to represent a certain
species of men to be found in almost every Scottish village of any
extent. Sergeant M‘Alpine, in the Legend of Montrose, is another
picture of them, and perhaps a more complete one than Clutterbuck.
They are the scattered wrecks of war, drifted upon the beach of retirement,
and left to waste away. They chiefly roost about little towns
in remote parts of the country, where society is not expensive, and
where half-pay procures the necessaries of life in the best possible style.
Here there always exist one or two of these individuals, rendering the
place respectable by their presence, and receiving a sort of spontaneous
homage from the people, in virtue of their independence, their gentility,
and their scars. Like the fading relics of the City Guard, they change
the most warlike of their habiliments for others more consonant with
the costumes of peace; but yet, though the scarlet be gone from the
coat and the sword from the hand, they do not altogether shake off the
airs of war. There is still something of the parade to be observed in the
small-ruffled shirt, the blue-necked coat, and the shoe-buckles; while
the starched and powdered rigidity in the cheek is as military as before,
and the walking cane is but a slight defalcation, in either dignity or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">{170}</span>
ferocity, from its predecessor, the sword. The walk, proud, portly,
and erect, is another relic of military habit that can never be
abandoned: and every other little punctuality of life and manners,
such as soldiers are accustomed to, is equally pertinacious in clinging
to the person of the disbanded officer. Such persons have long-winded
stories about Ticonderago and Mount Abraham, which every
one of their acquaintance has known by heart these twenty years; and
yet such is the respect paid to the good old gentleman, that amazement
as naturally follows the unfolding of the story, and the laugh comes as
ready on the catastrophe of the joke, as ever. No one could be uncivil
to <i>the Captain</i>. An excellent sketch of this description of persons is
to be found in the xxxth number of <i>Blackwood’s Magazine</i>, under the
title of “Lament for Captain Paton.” To this poem we refer the
reader for further particulars respecting the character represented in
Captain Clutterbuck.</p>


<h3>SCENERY.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> first and most prominent object of attention, in the scenery of
this Romance, is the Monastery itself, which every one knows to be
the renowned Abbey of Melrose, situated upwards of thirty-five miles
from Edinburgh to the south. It is the most beautiful and correct
specimen of Gothic architecture in Scotland; and has been universally
admired for the elegance and variety of its sculpture, the beauty of its
stone, the multiplicity of its statues, and the symmetry of its parts.
It was founded, as is well known, in 1136, by the pious David I., who
dedicated it to the Virgin Mary. To attempt a minute description of
it would be unnecessary, as we presume the great bulk of our readers
have seen the venerable pile itself, and those who have not, know the
many excellent sources from which this want can be supplied. Any
remarks of ours would give no additional lustre to the magnificent
ruins, or to the knowledge of the vicissitudes which it underwent in
the course of several ages.</p>

<p>Less than a quarter of a mile to the west of the Abbey, there is a
green bank which reaches to the height of some hundred feet above
the level of the Tweed. It is termed the Weird Hill, from a dim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">{171}</span>
tradition of the fairy tribe having haunted the spot, and held high
conclave touching the whimsies to be practised on the wights who
came under their ire. Immediately below this bank is the weird or
dam-dyke where it is believed the poor Sacristan was ducked by the
White Lady,—a lineal descendant of the ancient inhabitants of the
hill.</p>

<p>Following the course of the Tweed upwards—that is, towards the
west, about a mile and a half—we arrive at the ruins of the Old Bridge,
which once formed the regular communication to the Monastery. It
appears to have been constructed of timber, in the form of a drawbridge,
with three pillars, the middle pillar containing a wooden
house for the bridge-keeper. From this bridge there was a plain
way to Soutra Hill, along the northern bank of the Tweed, which was
named the <i>Girth-gate</i>,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> from an hospital, having the privileges of
Sanctuary, which was founded at Soutra by Malcolm IV., for the
relief of pilgrims and of poor and infirm persons who journeyed southwards.
This way was so good and easy, that, as a learned divine
remarked, it might strongly remind the traveller of the paths to the
cities of refuge. There were also two hostelries or inns at that place,
which could well afford, from their stores, an elegant <i>dejeune</i> to Sir
Piercie Shafton and his “fair Molindinara.”</p>

<p>A few yards from the bridge alluded to, the Elevand or Allan water
discharges itself into the Tweed. It is this little mountain brook
(rising from Allan-shaws on the boundary of Melrose parish towards
the north,) that forms the beautiful valley of Glendearg, described in
the romance. Advancing from the strath of the river in the northern
direction from Melrose, we discern the stream meandering in crystal
beauty through Langlee Wood, the property of Lord Somerville. The
serpentine turns of its course oblige the traveller frequently to pass and
repass it, in the line of the foot-track; but this is attended with no
inconvenience, from the number of rustic bridges which are thrown
over it. Emerging from the wood, the glen opens to the view. On one
side of it (to the east,) rises a precipitous bank or <i>scaur</i>,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of a reddish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">{172}</span>
colour, with here and there small patches of green sward. On the
opposite side the eminences do not swell so high, but form a perfect
contrast to the other. They have yielded their bosom to the industry
of man, and repay his labour with the rich fruits of autumn. This
improvement, however, is recent, as thirty years have scarcely elapsed
since they displayed an aspect almost as barren as the opposite ridge.
The little brook which runs below is not perceptible from either
height, so deeply is its channel embosomed in the narrow dell. As we
proceed onwards under a shade of alders, the glen gradually widens,
and, about 400 yards from whence it opens, a singular amphitheatre
meets the eye. It is somewhat in the shape of a crescent, through
which the water passes, leaving a pretty large channel. The opposing
precipices are thickly belted with copse-wood and several mountain
shrubs, which entwine with the branches of the beech and birch trees.
This place is called the Fairy or Nameless Dean, from some curiously-shaped
stones, which are said to be found after great falls of rain.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
But perhaps a better reason for the appellation arises from the situation
itself, which afforded a hidden rendezvous for the elfin race, with which
superstition peopled many parts of this district during the grandeur of
the Abbacy. No one, however, will deny that the White Lady of
Avenel might here have fixed her residence, and delivered her responses
to young Glendinning, or that it might have served as a secluded corner
for deadly strife. Though the holly bush cannot be discovered, yet
the spring of water may easily be conjectured, by the curious observer,
in the swampiness of portions of the ground now covered with sward.</p>

<p>The scenery of the remainder of the glen is extremely picturesque,
but unmarked by any striking varieties. The brook, like</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Streamlet of the mountain north,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now in a torrent racing forth,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>often dashes and foams over small interjecting rocks, and forms some
beautiful cascades. At other times,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">{173}</span></p>
<p>it sends a puny rill into some of the deep recesses or ravines which
have found their way between the hills. As the top of the glen is
neared, the hills show a greater slope, till we arrive at the green mount,
on which stands</p>


<h3 title="HILLSLOP TOWER.">HILLSLOP TOWER,</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the property of Borthwick of Crookston, from which there is no
doubt Glendearg has been depicted. The outward walls are still
entire, and, from their thickness and oblong form, with the port-holes
with which they abound, show it to have been formerly a place of
some strength. This seems also probable from the bleakness and
wildness of the surrounding scenery. High mountainous ridges, the
castles of nature, tower on every side, whose bosoms sometimes display
the naked grey rock encircled with fern and heath, and, at other times,
excellent verdure. But no cultivated field greets the eye, and the
solemn stillness which reigns around is only broken by the gentle
murmuring of the rivulet. The situation of the old tower is well
chosen, as, from the direction in which the hills run, a sort of circle
is formed, which not only screens it from the north and east winds,
but could easily debar all intercourse with the neighbouring country.</p>

<p>The date of the old tower, if a sculpture on the lintel of the entrance
can be credited, is 1585; and its inhabitants seem to have been of
some consequence from its interior appearance. At the foot of the
stair, which projects almost to the door, there is a long, narrow apartment,
with an arched roof lighted by a loophole-window, which, in the
olden times, formed the pen for the proprietor’s cattle when danger
was apprehended. It would suit well for the place of concealment
suggested by the miller’s daughter for Sir Piercie, before the unbarring
of the door. The decayed stone staircase leads to a common-sized
hall, with a large chimney-piece; but from the height of the walls,
and other circumstances, there must have been another room of equal
dimensions above it. There are also the remains of some small rooms,
which complete the accommodations of the mansion.</p>

<p>At a little distance from the foot of the tower, the straggling ruins of
small outhouses are discerned, which have been once connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">{174}</span>
the principal building. A short way farther, to the north, stand the
ruins of Colmsley and Langshaw, the former of which places is alluded
to by its name in the Romance.</p>

<p>Leaving Glendearg, it is necessary to follow the progress of the
romance towards the Castle of Avenel, <i>alias</i> Smailholm Tower. The
distance between the two places is nearly seven miles. There is no
regular road, but a track can be discovered, which runs eastward from
Hillslop, through the base of the Gattonside, a small chain which runs
from E. to W., in the direction of Melrose. The path is a most unenviable
one; for, besides the obstacles of ditch and furze, it is intersected
by deep morasses, which often render it quite impassable. In
threading it, we pass Threepwood and Blainslie Mosses, the favourite
resort of the Moss-troopers, who kept the peaceful inhabitants in continual
alarm. Their ravages were particularly extensive during the
usurpation of Cromwell, who allowed these depredators to scourge
Scotland unpunished.</p>


<h3>SMAILHOLM TOWER.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> hope to be able to show, from the description of this ancient
fortress, that it agrees in the leading features with Avenel Castle; and
if the reader will carry back his imagination for two centuries, he will
be better able to minute the resemblance. Smailholm tower, distant
about seven miles from Melrose to the east, and eight from Kelso to
the west, is the most perfect relic of the feudal keep in the south of
Scotland. It stands upon a rock of considerable height, in the centre
of an amphitheatre of craggy hills, which rise many hundred feet above
the level of the fertile plains of the Merse. Between the hills there
appear ravines of some depth, which, being covered with straggling
clumps of mountain shrubs, afford an agreeable relief to the rocks
which are continually starting upon the eye. Nature indeed seems to
have destined this isolated spot for a bulwark against the border
marauders; but its strength and security was not confined to the
encircling eminences. It chiefly lay in a deep and dangerous loch,
which completely environed the castle, and extended on every side to
the hills. Of this loch only a small portion remains, it having been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">{175}</span>
drained, many years ago, for the convenience of the farmer on whose
estate it was thought a nuisance. But the fact is evident, not only
from the swampiness of the ground, which only a few years since
created a dangerous morass, but from the appearance of the remaining
pool, which has hitherto defied the efforts of the numerous drain-beds
which surround it in every direction. Some people in the neighbourhood
recollect and can mark out the extent of the large sheet of water
which gave so romantic an air to this shred of antiquity.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And marvelled, as the aged hind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With some strange tale bewitched my mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of forayers who, with headlong force,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Down from that strength had spurred their horse,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">And, home-returning, filled the hall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With revel, wassail-rout, and ball.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is much feeling in this description; and so might there be, for
the early years of the bard were passed in the farmhouse of Sandy-knowe
(about a bow-shot from the tower,) with a maternal aunt, whose
mind was stored with border legends, which she related to her youthful
charge. With this instructress, and by poring incessantly for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">{176}</span>
many years on the relics of antiquity which are to be found in the
neighbourhood, it is probable that he first received the impressions
that afterwards came forward to such an illustrious maturity, and stored
his imagination with those splendid images of chivalry that have since
been embodied in imperishable song.</p>

<p>The external appearance of the tower may be briefly described.
The walls are of a quadrangular shape, and about nine feet in thickness.
They have none of the decorations of buttress or turret; and if
there were any ornamental carving, time has swept it away. A ruined
bartizan, which runs across three angles of the building, near the top,
is the only outward addition to the naked square <i>donjon</i>. The tower
has been entered on the <i>west</i> side, as all the other quarters rise perpendicularly
from the lake. Accordingly, there we discern the fragments
of a causeway, and the ruins of a broad portal, whence a drawbridge
seems to have communicated with an eminence about a hundred yards
distant. On this quarter also there may be traced the site of several
small booths which contained the retainers or men-at-arms of the feudal
lord.</p>

<p>On the west side,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> at a little distance from the Castle, is the Watch
Crag, a massive rock, on the top of which a fire was lit to announce
the approach of the English forayers to the neighbourhood. It is thus
described in the ballad of the Eve of St. John:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The bittern clamoured from the moss,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The wind blew loud and shrill;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet the craggy pathway she did cross</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To the airy beacon hill.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">
*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">I watched her steps, and silent came,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where she sat her all alone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No watchman stood by the dreary flame,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It burnèd all alone.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The interior of the castle bespeaks the mansion of the lesser Scottish
Baron. The sunk-floor, or keep, seems, from its structure, to have
contained the cattle of the Baron during seasons of alarm and invasion.
It is vaulted in the roof, and the light is admitted by a small outshot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">{177}</span>
Some have conjectured that this apartment was occupied as a dungeon,
or <i>Massy More</i>, where the captives taken in war were confined; but
this idea is improbable, not only from the comfortable appearance it
exhibits, but from the circumstance of every border fortress having a
place of the description formerly alluded to. Ascending a narrow
winding staircase, we arrive at a spacious hall, with the customary
distinction of a huge chimney-piece. The roof is gone, but the stone
props of it, which were of course the support of another floor, remain.
This latter would seem to have been the grand banqueting-room,
where the prodigal hospitality of our ancestors was displayed in its
usual style of extravagance. There also remain the marks of a higher
floor, thus making three storeys in all. The highest opens by a few
steps to the bartizan we have already mentioned, whence we ascend to
a grass-grown battlement, which commands a magnificent prospect.
To the east the spires of Berwick are descried, terminating an extensive
plain, beautified by the windings of the Tweed; to the south, the
conical summits of the Eildon Hills; to the north, the Lammermoors
rear their barren heads above the verdant hills of the Merse; and on
the south, the blue Cheviots are seen stretching through a lengthened
vista of smaller hills. Besides this grand outline, the eye can take in
a smaller range, beyond the rocky barrier of the Castle,—a most cultivated
dale, varied with peaceful hamlets, crystal streams, and towering
forests.</p>

<p>The history of the ancient possessors of the tower is involved in
obscurity. We only know that there were Barons of Smailholm, but
no memorable qualities are recorded of them. They were, as we
already observed, in the rank of the <i>lesser</i> Barons—that is, those who
had not the patent of peerage, but who were dignified only by the
extent of their possessions. But we know that the present proprietor,
Mr. Scott, of Harden, is not a descendant of that ancient family, as we
believe he acquired the estate by purchase. This gentleman cares so
little for the antique pile within his domains, that it is not long since
he intimated his intention to raze it to the ground, and from its
materials to erect a steading to the farm of Sandy-knowe. This would
have certainly taken place, had not his poetic kinsman, Sir Walter
Scott, interfered, and averted the sacrilegious intent; and to prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">{178}</span>
the recurrence of the resolution, he composed the admired ballad of
the Eve of St. John, which ranks among the best in the Border
Minstrelsy.</p>

<p>Tradition bears that it was inhabited by an aged lady at the beginning
of the last century, and several old people still alive remember of
the joists and window-frames being entire. A more interesting legend
exists, of which the purport is, that there was once a human skull
within this tower, possessed of the miraculous faculty of self-motion to
such a degree, that, if taken away to any distance, it was always sure
to have found its way back to its post by the next morning.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> This
may perhaps remind the reader of the strange journeys performed by
the “black volume” in the Monastery, whose rambling disposition
was such a source of terror and amazement to the monks of St. Mary’s.</p>

and indeed we may say foundation, in the ballad of “Adam Bell, Clym

bears, that these three “perilous outlaws,” having wrought great
devastation among the “foresters of the fee” and liege burghers of
Carlisle, while in the act of rescuing one of their companions from
prison, “fure up to London Town” to crave of their Sovereign a
charter of peace. This, by the intercession of the Queen, he grants
them; but no sooner is the royal word passed for their pardon, than
messengers arrive from the “North Countrye,” with the tidings of the
deadly havoc. The King happens to be quietly engaged in eating
his dinner at the time, and is completely thunderstruck at the intelligence,
so that,—</p>

<h3>KENILWORTH CASTLE.</h3>

<p class="center">“KENILWORTH.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kenilworth Castle</span> was in former times one of the most magnificent
piles in England. In the days of its prosperity it took a military
part, and it still retains traces of a warlike character,—though the
foliage which overspreads its remains, has softened down the ruins
into the appearance of a peaceful mansion. It was first destroyed by
Cromwell, in revenge of its possessor having favoured the royal cause.
Since then it has been gradually decaying, and another century will
probably bring it to the ground.</p>

<p>History mentions Kenilworth so early as the reign of Henry I. At
that time it was private property, but afterwards fell into the hands of
the Crown, in which it continued till Elizabeth bestowed it upon her
favourite, Leicester. This nobleman, profuse and extravagant to the
last degree, is said to have expended upon it no less than £60,000.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable events in the history of this castle is the
entertainment given by the latter proprietor to Elizabeth, which forms
the groundwork of the beautiful romance of “Kenilworth.” The traditionary
recollection of this grand festivity still lives in the country,
such having been the impression made upon the minds of the country
people by the grandeur of the occasion, that, in a lapse of 250 years, it
has not decayed in their remembrance. The following is an account,
given by an eye-witness, of her Majesty’s reception:—</p>

<p>“On the 9th of July, 1575, in the evening, the Queen approached
the first gate of the castle. The porter, a man tall in person, and of
stern countenance, with a club and keys, accosted her Majesty in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">{181}</span>
rough speech, full of passion, in metre, aptly made for the purpose,
and demanded the cause of all this din, and noise, and reeling about,
within the charge of his office. But upon seeing the Queen, as if he
had been struck instantaneously, and pierced, at the presence of a
personage so evidently expressing heroical sovereignty, he fell down
on his knees, humbly prays pardon for his ignorance, yields up his
club and keys, and proclaims open gates and free passage to all.</p>

<p>“Immediately the trumpeters, who stood on the wall, being six in
number, each eight feet high, with their silvery trumpets of five feet
long, sounded up a tune of welcome.</p>

<p>“Those harmonious blasters maintained their delectable music while
the Queen rode through the tilt-yard to the grand entrance of the
castle, which was washed by the lake.</p>

<p>“As she passed, a movable island approached, on which sat the
Lady of the Lake, who offered up her dominion to her Majesty, which
she had held since the days of King Arthur.</p>

<p>“This scene ended by a delectable harmony of hautbois, shalms,
cornets, with other loud musical instruments, playing while her
Majesty passed into the castle gate.</p>

<p>“When she entered the castle, a new scene was presented to her.—Several
of the heathen gods brought their gifts before her—Sylvanus,
god of the woods, Pomona with fruit, Ceres with corn, Bacchus with
grapes, Neptune with his trident, Mars with his arms, Apollo with
musical instruments,—all presented themselves to welcome her Majesty
in this singular place. An inscription over the gate explained the whole.</p>

<p>“Her Majesty was graciously pleased to accept the gifts of these
divinities, when was struck up a concert of flutes and other soft music.
When, alighting from her palfrey, she was conveyed into her chamber,
when her arrival was announced through the country by a peal of
cannon from the ramparts, and fireworks at night.”</p>

<p>Here the Queen was entertained for nineteen days, at an expense of
£1000 a day. The Queen’s genius seems to have been greatly consulted
in the pomp and solemnity of the whole, to which some have
added the entertainment of bear-baiting, etc.</p>

<p>The great clock was stopped during her Majesty’s continuance in the
castle, as if time had stood still, waiting on the Queen, and seeing
her subjects enjoy themselves.</p>

<h3>DAVID RAMSAY.</h3>

<p class="center">“NIGEL.”</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">In</span> the year 1634, Davy Ramsay, his Majesty’s clockmaker, made
an attempt to discover a precious deposit supposed to be concealed
in the cloister of Westminster Abbey, but a violent storm of wind put
a stop to his operations.”—<i>Lilly’s Life</i>, p. 47. This Ramsay, according
to Osborne, in his <i>Traditional Memorials</i>, used to deliver money
and watches, to be recompensed, with profit, when King James should
sit on the King’s chair at Rome, so near did he apprehend (by
astrology, doubtless,) the downfall of the papal power. His son
wrote several books on astrological subjects, of which his <i>Astrologia
Restaurata</i> is very entertaining. In the preface he says that his father
was of an ancient Scottish family, viz. of Eighterhouse, (Auchterhouse,)
“which had flourished in great glory for 1500 years, till these latter
days,” and derives the clan from Egypt, (it is wonderful that the idea
of gipsies did not startle him,) where the word Ramsay signifies joy
and delight. But he is extremely indignant that the world should
call his father “no better than a watchmaker,” asserting that he was,
in fact, page of the bedchamber, groom of the privy chamber, and
<i>keeper of all his Majestie’s clocks and watches</i>. “Now, how this,” quoth
he to the reader, “should prove him a watchmaker, and no other, more
than the late Earles of Pembroke ordinary chamberlains, because they
bore this office in the King’s house, do thou judge.”—<i>Mr. Sharp’s
Notes to Law’s Memorialls.</i></p>


<h3>THE REDGAUNTLET FAMILY.</h3>

<p class="center">“REDGAUNTLET.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is supposed that the characters, if not the fortunes, of the Redgauntlet
family, are founded upon those of the Griersons of Lagg.
This celebrated, or rather notorious family, is of considerable antiquity
in Galloway,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>—a district abounding, to a greater degree than either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">{183}</span>
Wales or the Highlands of Scotland, in families of remote origin and
honourable descent. Grierson of Lagg was one of those border
barons, whose fame and wealth the politic James V. endeavoured to
impair, by lodging himself and his whole retinue upon them during
a progress, to the irreparable ruin of their numerous flocks, and the
alienation of their broad lands. The Grierson family never recovered
the ground then lost; and has continued, down even to the present day,
to struggle with many difficulties in supporting its dignity. Sir Robert
Grierson, grandfather of the present Laird, made himself conspicuous
in the reigns of the latter Stuarts, by the high hand which he carried
in persecuting the recusant people of his own districts, and by the
oppression which the spirit of those unhappy times empowered him
to exercise upon his tenants and immediate dependants. He was but
a youth when these unhappy transactions took place, and survived
the Restoration nearly fifty years. His death, which took place in
1736, was in the remembrance of people lately alive. Many strange
traditionary stories are told about him in Dumfriesshire, and, in
particular, the groundwork of “Wandering Willie’s Tale” is quite
well known and accredited among the common people thereabouts.
The popular account of his last illness, death, and burial, are exceedingly
absurd and amusing, and we willingly give them a place in our
motley record.</p>

<p>Sir Robert Grierson died in the town of Dumfries. The house
where this memorable incident took place is still pointed out. It
is now occupied by a decent baker, and is a house of singular construction,
having a spiral or <i>turnpike</i> stair, like the old houses of
Edinburgh, on which account it is termed <i>the Turnpike House</i>. It
is at a distance of about two hundred yards from the river Nith;
and it is said that when Sir Robert’s feet were in their torment of
heat, and caused the cold water in which they were placed to boil,
relays of men were placed between the house and the river, to run
with pails of water to supply his bath; and still, as one pail was
handed in, the preceding one was at the height of boiling-heat, and
quite intolerable to the old Laird’s unfortunate extremities. Sir
Robert at length died, and was laid in a hearse to be taken to the
churchyard, which was some miles off. But, oh the mysterious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">{184}</span>
interferences of the evil one! though six stout horses essayed their
utmost might, they could not draw the wicked persecutor’s body
along; and there stood, fixed to the spot, as though they had been
yoked to the stedfast Criffel instead of an old family hearse! In this
emergency, when the funeral company were beginning to have their
own thoughts, Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick of Closeburn, an old friend
of the Laird’s, happened to come up, with two beautiful Spanish
horses, and, seeing the distress they were in, swore an oath, and
declared that he would drive old Legg, though the devil were in
him. So saying, he yoked his Spanish barbs to the hearse, mounted
the box himself, and drove away at a gallop towards the place of
interment. The horses ran with such swiftness that their master
could not restrain them, and they stopped at the churchyard gate, not
by any management or direction on his part, but by some miraculous
and supernatural agency. The company came slowly up in the course
of an hour thereafter, and Sir Robert Grierson was, after all, properly
interred, though not without the loss of Sir Thomas Kirkpatrick’s
beautiful horses, which died in consequence of their exertions.</p>


<p class="p2">The story of the Redgauntlet horse-shoe seems to have its foundation
in the following:—</p>

<p>“Major Weir’s mother appears to have set the example of witchcraft
to her children, as Jean Weir, while in prison, declared that
‘she was persuaded that her mother was a witch; for the secretest
thing that either I myself, or any of the family, could do, when once
a mark appeared upon her brow, she could tell it them, though
done at a great distance.’ Being demanded what sort of a mark
it was, she answered, ‘I have some such like mark myself, when
I please, upon my forehead.’ Whereupon she offered to uncover
her head, for visible satisfaction. The minister refusing to behold
it, and forbidding any discovery, was earnestly requested by some
spectators to allow the freedom. He yielded: she put back her head-dress,
and, seeming to frown, there was an exact horse-shoe, shaped
for nails, in her wrinkles, terrific enough, I assure you, to the stoutest
beholder.”—<i>Sinclair’s Satan’s Invisible World Discovered.</i></p>

rather late in taking his Lordship’s wig to George’s Square. Braxfield was too
impatient to wait; so he ran off with only his night-cap on his head, and was
fortunate enough to meet his tardy barber in Scott’s Close, when he seized his wig
with one hand, took off his night-cap with the other, and adjusting the whole matter
himself, sent Kay back with the undignified garment exued. This is a picture of
times gone by never to return; yet, as if to show how long traces of former manners
will survive their general decay, Lord Glenlee, who continues to live in Brown’s
Square, still dresses at home, and walks to court in the style of his predecessors.</p>

to Hallyards, in Manor parish. He was a most devoted and enthusiastic snuff-taker.
An amusing anecdote is preserved of the good old man’s simplicity of
character and love of snuff. One day, on his son’s arrival from Edinburgh, he
begged a pinch from young Adam’s box, which, on receiving, he declared to
be exceedingly good, and, of course, he inquired where that delightful mixture
was to be procured. “I got it from Traquair,” answered his son, alluding to a
tobacconist of that name, who dwelt at the corner of the piazzas leading into the
Parliament Square in Edinburgh. This the old gentleman did not comprehend, but
thought that his son meant Traquair, a little village about seven miles down Tweed,
beyond Peebles: and he actually despatched a man on horseback to that place to
procure some of the snuff which had so taken his fancy.</p>

Roslin, in consequence of a vow which he made in a curious emergency. One day,
hunting with King Robert I., he wagered his head that his hounds, <i>Help</i> and <i>Hold</i>,
would kill a certain beautiful white deer before it crossed the March burn. On
approaching the boundary, there seemed little chance of his hounds being successful;
but he went aside, and vowed a new chapel to St. Catherine if she would
intercede in his behalf; and she, graciously accepting of his offer, inspired the
hounds with supernatural vigour, so that they caught the deer just as she was
approaching the other side of the burn.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> The Gallowlee was not the usual place of execution; but the most flagrant
criminals were generally hung there in chains. Many of the martyrs were exhibited
on its summit, which Patrick Walker records with due horror. It ceased to be
employed for any purpose of this kind about the middle of the last century; since
which period with one exception, no criminals have been hung in chains in Scotland.
Its site was a rising ground immediately below the Botanic Garden, in Leith
Walk. When the New Town was in the progress of building, the sand used for the
composition of the mortar was procured from this spot; on which account the
miracle of a hill turned into a valley has taken place, and it is at the present day
that low beautiful esplanade of which Eagle and Henderson’s nursery is formed.
The Gallowlee turned out a source of great emolument to the possessor, sixpence
being allowed for every cartful of sand that was taken away. But the proprietor
was never truly benefited by the circumstance. Being addicted to drinking, he was
in the habit of spending every sixpence as he received it. A tavern was set up near
the spot, which was formerly unaccommodated with such a convenience, for the sole
purpose of selling whisky to <i>Matthew Richmond</i>,—and he was its only customer.
A fortune was soon acquired of the profits of the drink alone; and when the source
of the affluence ceased, poor Matthew was left poorer than he had originally been,
after having flung away the proffered chance of immense wealth. Never did
gamester more completely sink the last acre of his estate, than did <i>muckle Matthew
Richmond</i> drink down the last grain of the sand-hill of the Gallowlee!</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[68]</a> It ought to be mentioned that the tailor is also called in. In former times this
craftsman used to visit a farmer’s or cottager’s house, with all his train of callow
apprentices, once a year; and he lived in a family way with the inhabitants till
his work was finished, when he received twopence a-day for what he had done,
and went away to mis-shape human garments at some other house. About sixty
years ago, there was a sort of <i>strike</i> among the tailors, for a groat instead of twopence
a day; and this mighty wage continued without further increase till the
practice of taking tailors into the family has been nearly discontinued everywhere. It
was not the wages, however, but the food of the tailor, which constituted his chief
guerdon. The tailor was always well-fed, and if there were anything better than
another in the house it was reserved for him. When, in spring time, the gudewife’s
<i>mart-barrel</i> was getting nearly exhausted of its savoury contents, she would put off
the family with something less substantial for a few weeks in expectation of her
annual visitors—“We maun hain a bit for the tailyeours, ye ken!” she would say.</p>

<p>In support of what we advance in the text, we may observe that it is not more
than half a century since house-spinning was nearly as prevalent in the city of
Edinburgh as in the country, and it will yet be in the recollection of the most aged
of our readers, that signs were prevalent in the streets, bearing that “Lint was
given out to spin—in here,—down this close,—through this entry,” etc., etc. In
these days the Netherbow, a mean range of buildings at the eastern extremity of
the High Street, was entirely occupied by weavers who “took in <i>customer-wark</i>,”—in
proof of which fact we may cite the multiplicity of the windows in those houses,
which are still permitted to exist. Now, alas! the shuttles of this busy neighbourhood,
are as silent as the wheels of the spinsters, in whose hands pianofortes and
Brookman’s pencils supply the place of “rocks and reels.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
